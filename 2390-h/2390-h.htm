<a href="#contents">INTRODUCTION</a>
</h2>

<p>
The romantic and thrilling story of the southward and westward
migration of successive waves of transplanted European peoples
throughout the entire course of the eighteenth century is the
history of the growth and evolution of American democracy. Upon
the American continent was wrought out, through almost superhuman
daring, incredible hardship, and surpassing endurance, the
formation of a new society. The European rudely confronted with
the pitiless conditions of the wilderness soon discovered that
his maintenance, indeed his existence, was conditioned upon his
individual efficiency and his resourcefulness in adapting himself
to his environment. The very history of the human race, from the
age of primitive man to the modern era of enlightened
civilization, is traversed in the Old 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
Southwest throughout the course of half a century.
</p>

<p>
A series of dissolving views thrown upon the screen, picturing
the successive episodes in the history of a single family as it
wended its way southward along the eastern valleys, resolutely
repulsed the sudden attack of the Indians, toiled painfully up
the granite slopes of the Appalachians, and pitched down into the
transmontane wilderness upon the western waters, would give to
the spectator a vivid conception, in miniature, of the westward
movement. But certain basic elements in the grand procession,
revealed to the sociologist and the economist, would perhaps
escape his scrutiny. Back of the individual, back of the family,
even, lurk the creative and formative impulses of colonization,
expansion, and government. In the recognition of these social and
economic tendencies the individual merges into the group; the
group into the community; the community into a new society. In
this clear perspective of historic development the spectacular
hero at first sight seems to diminish; 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
but the mass, the movement, the social force which he epitomizes and 
interprets, gain in impressiveness and dignity.
<a href="#Note_1"><span class="superscript">[1]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
As the irresistible tide of migratory peoples swept ever
southward and westward, seeking room for expansion and economic
independence, a series of frontiers was gradually thrust out
toward the wilderness in successive waves of irregular
indentation. The true leader in this westward advance, to whom
less than his deserts has been accorded by the historian, is the
drab and mercenary trader with the Indians. The story of his
enterprise and of his adventures begins with the planting of
European civilization upon American soil. In the mind of the
aborigines he created the passion for the fruits, both good and
evil, of the white man's civilization, and he was welcomed by the
Indian because he also brought the means for repelling the
further advance of that civilization. The trader was of
incalculable service to the pioneer in first spying out the land
and charting the trackless wilderness. The trail rudely marked by
the buffalo became in time 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
the Indian path and the trader's "trace"; and the pioneers upon the 
westward march, following the line of least resistance, cut out their 
roads along these very routes. It is not too much to say that had it 
not been for the trader&mdash;brave, hardy, and adventurous however 
often crafty, unscrupulous, and immoral&mdash;the expansionist movement 
upon the American continent would have been greatly retarded.
</p>

<p>
So scattered and ramified were the enterprises and expeditions of
the traders with the Indians that the frontier which they
established was at best both shifting and unstable. Following far
in the wake of these advance agents of the civilization which
they so often disgraced, came the cattle-herder or rancher, who
took advantage of the extensive pastures and ranges along the
uplands and foot-hills to raise immense herds of cattle. Thus was
formed what might be called a rancher's frontier, thrust out in
advance of the ordinary farming settlements and serving as the
first serious barrier against the Indian invasion. The westward
movement of population is in this respect 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
a direct advance from the coast. Years before the influx into the 
Old Southwest of the tides of settlement from the northeast, the more 
adventurous struck straight westward in the wake of the fur-trader, 
and here and there erected the cattle-ranges beyond the farming frontier
of the piedmont region. The wild horses and cattle which roamed
at will through the upland barrens and pea-vine pastures were
herded in and driven for sale to the city markets of the East.
</p>

<p>
The farming frontier of the piedmont plateau constituted the real
backbone of western settlement. The pioneering farmers, with the
adventurous instincts of the hunter and the explorer, plunged
deeper and ever deeper into the wilderness, lured on by the
prospect of free and still richer lands in the dim interior.
Settlements quickly sprang up in the neighborhood of military
posts or rude forts established to serve as safeguards against
hostile attack; and trade soon flourished between these
settlements and the eastern centers, following the trails of the
trader and the more beaten paths 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
of emigration. The bolder settlers who ventured farthest to the westward 
were held in communication with the East through their dependence upon 
salt and other necessities of life; and the search for salt-springs in
the virgin wilderness was an inevitable consequence of the desire
of the pioneer to shake off his dependence upon the coast.
</p>

<p>
The prime determinative principle of the progressive American
civilization of the eighteenth century was the passion for the
acquisition of land. The struggle for economic independence
developed the germ of American liberty and became the
differentiating principle of American character. Here was a vast
unappropriated region in the interior of the continent to be had
for the seeking, which served as lure and inspiration to the man
daring enough to risk his all in its acquisition. It was in
accordance with human nature and the principles of political
economy that this unknown extent of uninhabited transmontane
land, widely renowned for beauty, richness, and fertility, should
excite grandiose dreams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
in the minds of English and Colonials alike. England was said to be 
"New Land mad and everybody there has his eye fixed on this country." 
<a href="#Note_2"><span class="superscript">[2]</span></a>
Groups of wealthy or well-to-do individuals organized themselves into 
land companies for the colonization and exploitation of the West. The 
pioneer promoter was a powerful creative force in westward expansion; 
and the activities of the early land companies were decisive factors
in the colonization of the wilderness. Whether acting under the
authority of a crown grant or proceeding on their own authority,
the land companies tended to give stability and permanence to
settlements otherwise hazardous and insecure.
</p>

<p>
The second determinative impulse of the pioneer civilization was
<i>wanderlust</i>&mdash;the passionately inquisitive instinct of the hunter,
the traveler, and the explorer. This restless class of nomadic
wanderers was responsible in part for the royal proclamation of
1763, a secondary object of which, according to Edmund Burke, was
the limitation of the colonies on the West, as "the charters of
many of our old 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
colonies give them, with few exceptions, no
bounds to the westward but the South Sea." The Long Hunters,
taking their lives in their hands, fared boldly forth to a fabled
hunter's paradise in the far-away wilderness, because they were
driven by the irresistible desire of a Ponce de Leon or a De Soto
to find out the truth about the unknown lands beyond.
</p>

<p>
But the hunter was not only thrilled with the passion of the
chase and of discovery; he was intent also upon collecting the
furs and skins of wild animals for lucrative barter and sale in
the centers of trade. He was quick to make "tomahawk claims" and
to assert "corn rights" as he spied out the rich virgin land for
future location and cultivation. Free land and no taxes appealed
to the backwoodsman, tired of paying quit-rents to the agents of
wealthy lords across the sea. Thus the settler speedily followed
in the hunter's wake. In his wake also went many rude and lawless
characters of the border, horse thieves and criminals of
different sorts, who sought to hide their delinquencies in the
merciful liberality 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
of the wilderness. For the most part, however, it was the salutary 
instinct of the home-builder&mdash;the man with the ax, who made a 
little clearing in the forest and built there a rude cabin that he 
bravely defended at all risks against continued assaults&mdash;which, 
in defiance of every restraint, irresistibly thrust westward the thin 
and jagged line of the frontier. The ax and the surveyor's chain, 
along with the rifle and the hunting-knife, constituted the armorial 
bearings of the pioneer. With individual as with corporation, with 
explorer as with landlord, land-hunger was the master impulse of the 
era.
</p>

<p>
The various desires which stimulated and promoted westward
expansion were, to be sure, often found in complete conjunction.
The trader sought to exploit the Indian for his own advantage,
selling him whisky, trinkets, and firearms in return for rich
furs and costly peltries; yet he was often a hunter himself and
collected great stores of peltries as the result of his solitary
and protracted hunting-expeditions. The rancher and the herder
sought to 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
exploit the natural vegetation of marsh and upland, the
cane-brakes and pea-vines; yet the constantly recurring need for
fresh pasturage made him a pioneer also, drove him ever nearer to
the mountains, and furnished the economic motive for his westward
advance. The small farmer needed the virgin soil of the new
region, the alluvial river-bottoms, and the open prairies, for
the cultivation of his crops and the grazing of his cattle; yet
in the intervals between the tasks of farm life he scoured the
wilderness in search of game and spied out new lands for future
settlement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_xviii_2" id="Page_xviii_2"></a>
This restless and nomadic race, says the keenly observant Francis
Baily, "delight much to live on the frontiers, where they can
enjoy undisturbed, and free from the control of any laws, the
blessings which nature has bestowed upon them." 
<a href="#Note_3"><span class="superscript">[3]</span></a>
Independence of
spirit, impatience of restraint, the inquisitive nature, and the
nomadic temperament&mdash;these are the strains in the American
character of the eighteenth century which ultimately blended to
create a typical democracy. The rolling 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
of wave after wave of
settlement westward across the American continent, with a
reversion to primitive conditions along the line of the farthest
frontier, and a marked rise in the scale of civilization at each
successive stage of settlement, from the western limit to the
eastern coast, exemplifies from one aspect the history of the
American people during two centuries. 
<a href="#Note_4"><span class="superscript">[4]</span></a>
This era, constituting the
first stage in our national existence, and productive of a
buoyant national character shaped in democracy upon a free soil,
closed only yesterday with the exhaustion of cultivable free
land, the disappearance of the last frontier, and the recent
death of "Buffalo Bill". The splendid inauguration of the period,
in the region of the Carolinas, Virginia, Tennessee, and
Kentucky, during the second half of the eighteenth century, is
the theme of this story of the pioneers of the Old Southwest.

      The Migration of the Peoples

<p class="intro">
Inhabitants flock in here daily, mostly from Pensilvania and
other parts of America, who are over-stocked with people and some
directly from Europe, they commonly seat themselves towards the
West, and have got near the mountains.

<span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">t</span> 
the opening of the eighteenth century the tide 
of population had swept inland to the "fall line," the westward boundary 
of the established settlements. The actual frontier had been advanced by
the more aggressive pioneers to within fifty miles of the Blue
Ridge. So rapid was the settlement in North Carolina that in the
interval 1717-32 the population quadrupled in numbers. A map of
the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
colonial settlements in 1725 reveals a narrow strip of
populated land along the Atlantic coast, of irregular
indentation, with occasional isolated nuclei of settlements
further in the interior. The civilization thus established
continued to maintain a close and unbroken communication with
England and the Continent. As long as the settlers, for economic
reasons, clung to the coast, they reacted but slowly to the
transforming influences of the frontier. Within a triangle of
continental altitude with its apex in New England, bounded on the
east by the Atlantic, and on the west by the Appalachian range,
lay the settlements, divided into two zones&mdash;tidewater and
piedmont. As no break occurred in the great mountain system south
of the Hudson and Mohawk valleys, the difficulties of cutting a
passage through the towering wall of living green long proved an
effective obstacle to the crossing of the grim mountain barrier.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning the settlements gradually extended westward from
the coast in irregular outline, the indentations taking form around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
such natural centers of attraction as areas of fertile
soil, frontier posts, mines, salt-springs, and stretches of
upland favorable for grazing. After a time a second advance of
settlement was begun in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland,
running in a southwesterly direction along the broad terraces to
the east of the Appalachian Range, which in North Carolina lies
as far as two hundred and fifty miles from the sea. The Blue
Ridge in Virginia and a belt of pine barrens in North Carolina
were hindrances to this advance, but did not entirely check it.
This second streaming of the population thrust into the long,
narrow wedge of the piedmont zone a class of people differing in
spirit and in tendency from their more aristocratic and
complacent neighbors to the east.
</p>

<p>
These settlers of the Valley of Virginia and the North Carolina
piedmont region&mdash;English, Scotch-Irish, Germans, Scotch, Irish,
Welsh, and a few French&mdash;were the first pioneers of the Old
Southwest. From the joint efforts of two strata of population,
geographically, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
socially, and economically distinct&mdash;tidewater
and piedmont, Old South and New South&mdash;originated and flowered
the third and greatest movement of westward expansion, opening
with the surmounting of the mountain barrier and ending in the
occupation and assumption of the vast medial valley of the
continent.
</p>

<p>
Synchronous with the founding of Jamestown in Virginia,
significantly enough, was the first planting of Ulster with the
English and Scotch. Emigrants from the Scotch Lowlands, sometimes
as many as four thousand a year (1625), continued throughout the
century to pour into Ulster. "Those of the North of Ireland&hellip;,"
as pungently described in 1679 by the Secretary of State,
Leoline Jenkins, to the Duke of Ormond, "are most Scotch and
Scotch breed and are the Northern Presbyterians and phanatiques,
lusty, able-bodied, hardy and stout men, where one may see three
or four hundred at every meeting-house on Sunday, and all the
North of Ireland is inhabited by these, which is the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
popular
place of all Ireland by far. They are very numerous and greedy
after land." During the quarter of a century after the English
Revolution of 1688 and the Jacobite uprising in Ireland, which
ended in 1691 with the complete submission of Ireland to William
and Mary, not less than fifty thousand Scotch, according to
Archbishop Synge, settled in Ulster. Until the beginning of the
eighteenth century there was no considerable emigration to
America; and it was first set up as a consequence of English
interference with trade and religion. Repressive measures passed
by the English parliament (1665-1699), prohibiting the
exportation from Ireland to England and Scotland of cattle,
beef, pork, dairy products, etc., and to any country whatever of
manufactured wool, had aroused deep resentment among the
Scotch-Irish, who had built up a great commerce. This discontent
was greatly aggravated by the imposition of religious
disabilities upon the Presbyterians, who, in addition to having
to pay tithes for the support of the established church, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
excluded from all civil and military office (1704), while their
ministers were made liable to penalties for celebrating
marriages.
</p>

<p>
This pressure upon a high-spirited people resulted inevitably in
an exodus to the New World. The principal ports by which the
Ulsterites entered America were Lewes and Newcastle (Delaware),
Philadelphia and Boston. The streams of immigration steadily
flowed up the Delaware Valley; and by 1720 the Scotch-Irish began
to arrive in Bucks County. So rapid was the rate of increase in
immigration that the number of arrivals soon mounted from a few
hundred to upward of six thousand, in a single year (1729); and
within a few years this number was doubled. According to the
meticulous Franklin, the proportion increased from a very small
element of the population of Pennsylvania in 1700 to one fourth
of the whole in 1749, and to one third of the whole (350,000) in
1774. Writing to the Penns in 1724, James Logan, Secretary of the
Province, caustically refers to the Ulster settlers on the
disputed Maryland 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
line as "these bold and indigent strangers,
saying as their excuse when challenged for titles, that we had
solicited for colonists and they had come accordingly." The
spirit of these defiant squatters is succinctly expressed in
their statement to Logan that it "was against the laws of God and
nature that so much land should be idle while so many Christians
wanted it to work on and to raise their bread."
</p>

<p>
The rising scale of prices for Pennsylvania lands, changing from
ten pounds and two shillings quit-rents per hundred acres in 1719
to fifteen pounds ten shillings per hundred acres with a
quit-rent of a halfpenny per acre in 1732, soon turned the eyes
of the thrifty Scotch-Irish settlers southward and southwestward.
In Maryland in 1738 lands were offered at five pounds sterling
per hundred acres. Simultaneously, in the Valley of Virginia free
grants of a thousand acres per family were being made. In the
North Carolina piedmont region the proprietary, Lord Granville,
through his agents was disposing of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
most desirable lands to
settlers at the rate of three shillings proclamation money for
six hundred and forty acres, the unit of land-division; and was
also making large free grants on the condition of seating a
certain proportion of settlers. "Lord Carteret's land in
Carolina," says North Carolina's first American historian, "where
the soil was cheap, presented a tempting residence to people of
every denomination. Emigrants from the north of Ireland, by the
way of Pennsylvania, flocked to that country; and a considerable
part of North Carolina &hellip; is inhabited by those people or
their descendants." 
<a href="#Note_5"><span class="superscript">[5]</span></a>
From 1740 onward, attracted by the rich lure
of cheap and even free lands in Virginia and North Carolina, a
tide of immigration swept ceaselessly into the valleys of the
Shenandoah, the Yadkin, and the Catawba. The immensity of this
mobile, drifting mass, which sometimes brought "more than 400
families with horse waggons and cattle" into North Carolina in a
single year (1752-3), is attested by the fact that from 1732 to
1754, mainly as the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
result of the Scotch-Irish inundation, the
population of North Carolina more than doubled.
</p>

<p>
The second important racial stream of population in the
settlement of the same region was composed of Germans, attracted
to this country from the Palatinate. Lured on by the highly
colored stories of the commercial agents for promoting
immigration&mdash;the "newlanders," who were thoroughly unscrupulous
in their methods and extravagant in their representations&mdash;a
migration from Germany began in the second decade of the
eighteenth century and quickly assumed alarming proportions.
Although certain of the emigrants were well-to-do, a very great
number were "redemptioners" (indentured servants), who in order
to pay for their transportation were compelled to pledge
themselves to several years of servitude. This economic condition
caused the German immigrant, wherever he went, to become a
settler of the back country, necessity compelling him to pass by
the more expensive lands near the coast.
</p>

<p>
For well-nigh sixty years the influx of German 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
immigrants of various sects was very great, averaging something like 
fifteen hundred a year into Pennsylvania alone from 1727 to 1775. 
Indeed, Pennsylvania, one third of whose population at the beginning of
the Revolution was German, early became the great distributing
center for the Germans as well as for the Scotch-Irish. Certainly
by 1727 Adam M&uuml;ller and his fellow Germans had established the
first permanent white settlement in the Valley of Virginia. 
<a href="#Note_6"><span class="superscript">[6]</span></a>
By 1732 Jost Heydt, accompanied by sixteen families, came from York,
Pennsylvania, and settled on the Opeckon River, in the
neighborhood of the present Winchester. 
<a href="#Note_7"><span class="superscript">[7]</span></a>
There is no longer any
doubt that "the portion of the Shenandoah Valley sloping to the
north was almost entirely settled by Germans."
</p>

<p>
It was about the middle of the century that these pioneers of the
Old Southwest, the shrewd, industrious, and thrifty Pennsylvania
Germans (who came to be generally called "Pennsylvania Dutch"
from the incorrect translation of <i>Pennsylv&auml;nische Deutsche</i>),
began 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to pour into the piedmont region of North Carolina. In the
autumn, after the harvest was in, these ambitious Pennsylvania
pioneers would pack up their belongings in wagons and on beasts
of burden and head for the southwest, trekking down in the manner
of the Boers of South Africa. This movement into the fertile
valley lands of the Yadkin and the Catawba continued unabated
throughout the entire third quarter of the century. Owing to
their unfamiliarity with the English language and the solidarity
of their instincts, the German settlers at first had little share
in government. But they devotedly played their part in the
defense of the exposed settlements and often bore the brunt of
Indian attack.
<a href="#Note_8"><span class="superscript">[8]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The bravery and hardihood displayed by the itinerant missionaries
sent out by the Pennsylvania Synod under the direction of Count
Zinzendorf (1742-8), and by the Moravian Church (1748-53), are
mirrored in the numerous diaries, written in German, happily
preserved to posterity in religious archives of Pennsylvania and
North Carolina. These 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
simple, earnest crusaders, animated by pure
and unselfish motives, would visit on a single tour of a thousand
miles the principal German settlements in Maryland and Virginia
(including the present West Virginia). Sometimes they would make
an extended circuit through North Carolina, South Carolina, and
even Georgia, everywhere bearing witness to the truth of the
gospel and seeking to carry the most elemental forms of the
Christian religion, preaching and prayer, to the primitive
frontiersmen marooned along the outer fringe of white
settlements. These arduous journeys in the cause of piety place
this type of pioneer of the Old Southwest in alleviating contrast
to the often relentless and bloodthirsty figure of the rude
borderer.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_14_2" id="Page_14_2"></a>
Noteworthy among these pious pilgrimages is the Virginia journey
of Brothers Leonhard Schnell and John Brandm&uuml;ller (October 12 to
December 12, 1749). 
<a href="#Note_9"><span class="superscript">[9]</span></a>
At the last outpost of civilization, the
scattered settlements in Bath and Alleghany counties, these
courageous missionaries&mdash;feasting the while solely on bear 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
meat,
for there was no bread&mdash;encountered conditions of almost
primitive savagery, of which they give this graphic picture:
"Then we came to a house, where we had to lie on bear skins
around the fire like the rest.&hellip; The clothes of the people
consist of deer skins, their food of Johnny cakes, deer and bear
meat. A kind of white people are found here, who live like
savages. Hunting is their chief occupation." Into the valley of
the Yadkin in December, 1752, came Bishop Spangenberg and a party
of Moravians, accompanied by a surveyor and two guides, for the
purpose of locating the one hundred thousand acres of land which
had been offered them on easy terms the preceding year by Lord
Granville. This journey was remarkable as an illustration of
sacrifices willingly made and extreme hardships uncomplainingly
endured for the sake of the Moravian brotherhood. In the back
country of North Carolina near the Mulberry Fields they found the
whole woods full of Cherokee Indians engaged in hunting. A
beautiful site for the projected settlement met 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
their delighted
gaze at this place; but they soon learned to their regret that it
had already been "taken up" by Daniel Boone's future
father-in-law, Morgan Bryan.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_16_2" id="Page_16_2"></a>
On October 8, 1753, a party of twelve single men headed by the
Rev. Bernhard Adam Grube, set out from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
to trek down to the new-found haven in the Carolina
hinterland&mdash;"a corner which the Lord has reserved for the
Brethren"&mdash;in Anson County. 
<a href="#Note_10"><span class="superscript">[10]</span></a>
Following for the most part the great
highway extending from Philadelphia to the Yadkin, over which
passed the great throng sweeping into the back country of North
Carolina&mdash;through the Valley of Virginia and past Robert Luhny's
mill on the James River&mdash;they encountered many hardships along
the way. Because of their "long wagon," they had much difficulty
in crossing one steep mountain; and of this experience Brother
Grube, with a touch of modest pride, observes: "People had told
us that this hill was most dangerous, and that we would scarcely
be able to cross it, for Morgan Bryan, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
the first to travel this way, had to take the wheels off his wagon and 
carry it piecemeal to the top, and had been three months on the journey 
from the Shanidore [Shenandoah] to the Etkin [Yadkin]."
</p>

<p>
These men were the highest type of the pioneers of the Old
Southwest, inspired with the instinct of home-makers in a land
where, if idle rumor were to be credited, "the people lived like
wild men, never hearing of God or His Word." In one hand they bore
the implement of agriculture, in the other the book of the gospel
of Jesus Christ. True faith shines forth in the simply eloquent
words: "We thanked our Saviour that he had so graciously led us
hither, and had helped us through all the hard places, for no
matter how dangerous it looked, nor how little we saw how we
could win through, everything always went better than seemed
possible." The promise of a new day&mdash;the dawn of the heroic
age&mdash;rings out in the pious carol of camaraderie at their
journey's end:

<p class="chaptertitle">
      The Cradle of Westward Expansion
</p>


<p class="intro">
In the year 1746 I was up in the country that is now Anson,
Orange and Rowan Counties, there was not then above one hundred
fighting men there is now at least three thousand for the most
part Irish Protestants and Germans and dailey 
increasing.

<br>


<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> 
conquest of the West is usually 
attributed to the ready initiative, the stern self-reliance, and 
the libertarian instinct of the expert backwoodsmen. These bold, 
nomadic spirits were animated by an unquenchable desire to plunge 
into the wilderness in search of an El Dorado at the outer verge 
of civilization, free of taxation, quit-rents, and the law's 
restraint. They longed to build homes for themselves and their 
descendants in a limitless, free domain; or else to fare deeper 
and deeper into the trackless forests in search of adventure. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Yet one must not
overlook the fact that behind Boone and pioneers of his stamp
were men of conspicuous civil and military genius, constructive
in purpose and creative in imagination, who devoted their best
gifts to actual conquest and colonization. These men of large
intellectual mold&mdash;themselves surveyors, hunters, and
pioneers&mdash;were inspired with the larger vision of the
expansionist. Whether colonizers, soldiers, or speculators on the
grand scale, they sought to open at one great stroke the vast
trans-Alleghany regions as a peaceful abode for mankind.
</p>

<p>
Two distinct classes of society were gradually drawing apart from
each other in North Carolina and later in Virginia&mdash;the pioneer
democracy of the back country and the upland, and the planter
aristocracy of the lowland and the tide-water region. From the
frontier came the pioneer explorers whose individual enterprise
and initiative were such potent factors in the exploitation of
the wilderness. From the border counties still in contact with
the East came a number of leaders. Thus in the heart 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
of the Old
Southwest the two determinative principles already referred to,
the inquisitive and the acquisitive instincts, found a fortunate
conjunction. The exploratory passion of the pioneer, directed in
the interest of commercial enterprise, prepared the way for the
great westward migration. The warlike disposition of the hardy
backwoodsman, controlled by the exercise of military strategy,
accomplished the conquest of the trans-Alleghany country.
</p>

<p>
Fleeing from the traditional bonds of caste and aristocracy in
England and Europe, from economic boycott and civil oppression,
from religious persecution and favoritism, many worthy members of
society in the first quarter of the eighteenth century sought a
haven of refuge in the "Quackerthal" of William Penn, with its
trustworthy guarantees of free tolerance in religious faith and
the benefits of representative self-government. From East
Devonshire in England came George Boone, the grandfather of the
great pioneer, and from Wales came Edward Morgan, whose daughter
Sarah became the wife of Squire Boone, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Daniel's father. These
were conspicuous representatives of the Society of Friends, drawn
thither by the roseate representations of the great Quaker,
William Penn, and by his advanced views on popular government and
religious toleration. 
<a href="#Note_11"><span class="superscript">[11]</span></a>
Hither, too, from Ireland, whither he had
gone from Denmark, came Morgan Bryan, settling in Chester County,
prior to 1719; and his children, William, Joseph, James, and
Morgan, who more than half a century later gave the name to
Bryan's Station in Kentucky, were destined to play important
r&ocirc;les in the drama of westward migration. 
<a href="#Note_12"><span class="superscript">[12]</span></a>
In September, 1734,
Michael Finley from County Armagh, Ireland, presumably
accompanied by his brother Archibald Finley, settled in Bucks
County, Pennsylvania. According to the best authorities,
Archibald Finley was the father of John Finley, or Findlay as he
signed himself, Boone's guide and companion in his exploration of
Kentucky in 1769-71. 
<a href="#Note_13"><span class="superscript">[13]</span></a>
To Pennsylvania also came Mordecai Lincoln,
great-grandson of Samuel Lincoln, who had emigrated from England
to Hingham, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Massachusetts, as early as 1637. This Mordecai
Lincoln, who in 1720 settled in Chester County, Pennsylvania, the
great-great-grandfather of President Lincoln, was the father of
Sarah Lincoln, who was wedded to William Boone, and of Abraham
Lincoln, who married Anne Boone, William's first cousin. Early
settlers in Pennsylvania were members of the Hanks family, one of
whom was the maternal grandfather of President Lincoln.
<a href="#Note_14"><span class="superscript">[14]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
No one race or breed of men can lay claim to exclusive credit for
leadership in the hinterland movement and the conquest of the
West. Yet one particular stock of people, the Ulster Scots,
exhibited with most completeness and picturesqueness a group of
conspicuous qualities and attitudes which we now recognize to be
typical of the American character as molded by the conditions of
frontier life. Cautious, wary, and reserved, these Scots
concealed beneath a cool and calculating manner a relentlessness
in reasoning power and an intensity of conviction which glowed
and burned with almost fanatical ardor. Strict in religious
observance 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
and deep in spiritual fervor, they never lost sight of
the main chance, combining a shrewd practicality with a wealth of
devotion. It has been happily said of them that they kept the
Sabbath and everything else they could lay their hands on. In the
polity of these men religion and education went hand in hand; and
they habitually settled together in communities in order that
they might have teachers and preachers of their own choice and
persuasion.
</p>

<p>
In little-known letters and diaries of travelers and itinerant
ministers may be found many quaint descriptions and faithful
characterizations of the frontier settlers in their habits of
life and of the scenes amidst which they labored. In a letter to
Edmund Fanning, the cultured Robin Jones, agent of Lord Granville
and Attorney-General of North Carolina, summons to view a piquant
image of the western border and borderers: "The inhabitants are
hospitable in their way, live in plenty and dirt, are stout, of
great prowess in manly athletics; and, in private conversation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
bold, impertinent, and vain. In the art of war (after the Indian
manner) they are well-skilled, are enterprising and fruitful of
strategies; and, when in action, are as bold and intrepid as the
ancient Romans. The Shawnese acknowledge them their superiors
even in their own way of fighting.&hellip; [The land] may be truly
called the land of the mountains, for they are so numerous that
when you have reached the summit of one of them, you may see
thousands of every shape that the imagination can suggest,
seeming to vie with each other which should raise his lofty head
to touch the clouds.&hellip; It seems to me that nature has been
wanton in bestowing her blessings on that country."
<a href="#Note_15"><span class="superscript">[15]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
An excellent pen-picture of educational and cultural conditions
in the backwoods of North Carolina, by one of the early settlers
in the middle of the century, exhibits in all their barren
cheerlessness the hardships and limitations of life in the
wilderness. The father of William Few, the narrator, had trekked
down from Maryland and settled in Orange County, some 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
miles east
of the little hamlet of Hillsborough. "In that country at that
time there were no schools, no churches or parsons, or doctors or
lawyers; no stores, groceries or taverns, nor do I recollect
during the first two years any officer, ecclesiastical, civil or
military, except a justice of the peace, a constable and two or
three itinerant preachers.&hellip; These people had few wants, and
fewer temptations to vice than those who lived in more refined
society, though ignorant. They were more virtuous and more happy.&hellip;
A schoolmaster appeared and offered his services to teach
the children of the neighborhood for twenty shillings each per
year.&hellip; In that simple state of society money was but little
known; the schoolmaster was the welcome guest of his pupil, fed
at the bountiful table and clothed from the domestic loom.&hellip;
In that country at that time there was great scarcity of books."

The journals of itinerant ministers through the Valley of
Virginia and the Carolina piedmont zone yield precious mementoes
of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
people, their longing after the things of the spirit, and
their pitiful isolation from the regular preaching of the gospel.
These missionaries were true pioneers in this Old Southwest,
ardent, dauntless, and heroic&mdash;carrying the word into remote
places and preaching the gospel beneath the trees of the forest.
In his journal (1755-6), the Rev. Hugh McAden, born in
Pennsylvania of Scotch-Irish parentage, a graduate of Nassau Hall
(1753), makes the unconsciously humorous observation that
wherever he found Presbyterians he found people who "seemed
highly pleased, and very desirous to hear the word"; whilst
elsewhere he found either dissension and defection to Baptist
principles, or "no appearance of the life of religion." In the
Scotch-Irish Presbyterian settlements in what is now Mecklenburg
County, the cradle of American liberty, he found "pretty serious,
judicious people" of the stamp of Moses, William, and James
Alexander. While traveling in the upper country of South
Carolina, he relates with gusto the story of "an old gentleman
who said to the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Governor of South Carolina, when he was in those
parts, in treaty with the Cherokee Indians that 'he had never
seen a shirt, been in a fair, heard a sermon, or seen a minister
in all his life.' Upon which the governor promised to send him up
a minister, that he might hear one sermon before he died." The
minister came and preached; and this was all the preaching that
had been heard in the upper part of South Carolina before Mr.
McAden's visit.
<a href="#Note_17"><span class="superscript">[17]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Such, then, were the rude and simple people in the back country
of the Old Southwest&mdash;the deliberate and self-controlled English,
the aggressive, land-mongering Scotch-Irish, the buoyant Welsh,
the thrifty Germans, the debonair French, the impetuous Irish,
and the calculating Scotch. The lives they led were marked by
independence of spirit, democratic instincts, and a forthright
simplicity. In describing the condition of the English settlers
in the backwoods of Virginia, one of their number, Doddridge,
says: "Most of the articles were of domestic manufacture. There
might 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
have been incidentally a few things brought to the country
for sale in a primitive way, but there was no store for general
supply. The table furniture usually consisted of wooden vessels,
either turned or coopered. Iron forks, tin cups, etc., were
articles of rare and delicate luxury. The food was of the most
wholesome and primitive kind. The richest meat, the finest
butter, and best meal that ever delighted man's palate were here
eaten with a relish which health and labor only know. The
hospitality of the people was profuse and proverbial."
</p>

<p>
The circumstances of their lives compelled the pioneers to become
self-sustaining. Every immigrant was an adept at many trades. He
built his own house, forged his own tools, and made his own
clothes. At a very early date rifles were manufactured at the
High Shoals of the Yadkin; Squire Boone, Daniel's brother, was an
expert gunsmith. The difficulty of securing food for the
settlements forced every man to become a hunter and to scour the
forest for wild game. Thus the pioneer, through 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
force of sheer
necessity, became a dead shot&mdash;which stood him in good stead in
the days of Indian incursions and bloody retaliatory raids.
Primitive in their games, recreations, and amusements, which not
infrequently degenerated into contests of savage brutality, the
pioneers always set the highest premium upon personal bravery,
physical prowess, and skill in manly sports. At all public
gatherings, general musters, "vendues" or auctions, and even
funerals, whisky flowed with extraordinary freedom. It is worthy
of record that among the effects of the Rev. Alexander Craighead,
the famous teacher and organizer of Presbyterianism in
Mecklenburg and the adjoining region prior to the Revolution,
were found a punch bowl and glasses.
</p>

<p>
The frontier life, with its purifying and hardening influence,
bred in these pioneers intellectual traits which constitute the
basis of the American character. The single-handed and successful
struggle with nature in the tense solitude of the forest
developed a spirit of individualism, restive under control. On
the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
other hand, the sense of sharing with others the arduous
tasks and dangers of conquering the wilderness gave birth to a
strong sense of solidarity and of human sympathy. With the lure
of free lands ever before them, the pioneers developed a
restlessness and a nervous energy, blended with a buoyancy of
spirit, which are fundamentally American. Yet this same
untrammeled freedom occasioned a disregard for law and a defiance
of established government which have exhibited themselves
throughout the entire course of our history. Initiative,
self-reliance, boldness in conception, fertility in resource,
readiness in execution, acquisitiveness, inventive genius,
appreciation of material advantages&mdash;these, shot through with a
certain fine idealism, genial human sympathy, and a high romantic
strain&mdash;are the traits of the American national type as it
emerged from the Old Southwest.

Far from the bustle of the world, they live 
in the most delightful climate, and richest soil imaginable; they are
everywhere surrounded with beautiful prospects and sylvan scenes;
lofty mountains, transparent streams, falls of water, rich
valleys, and majestic woods; the whole interspersed with an
infinite variety of flowering shrubs, constitute the landscape
surrounding them; they are subject to few diseases; are generally
robust; and live in perfect liberty; they are ignorant of want
and acquainted with but few vices. Their inexperience of the
elegancies of life precludes any regret that they possess not the
means of enjoying them, but they possess what many princes would
give half their dominion for, health, content, and tranquillity
of mind.

two streams of Ulstermen, the greater through 
Philadelphia, the lesser through Charleston, which poured into the Carolinas
toward the middle of the century, quickly flooded the back
country. The former occupied the Yadkin Valley and the region to
the westward, the latter the Waxhaws and the Anson County region
to the northwest. The 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
first settlers were known as the
"Pennsylvania Irish," because they had first settled in
Pennsylvania after migrating from the north of Ireland; while
those who came by way of Charleston were known as the
"Scotch-Irish." The former, who had resided in Pennsylvania long
enough to be good judges of land, shrewdly made their settlements
along the rivers and creeks. The latter, new arrivals and less
experienced, settled on thinner land toward the heads of creeks
and water courses.
<a href="#Note_18"><span class="superscript">[18]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_33_2" id="Page_33_2"></a>
Shortly prior to 1735, Morgan Bryan, his wife Martha, and eight
children, together with other families of Quakers from
Pennsylvania, settled upon a large tract of land on the northwest
side of the Opeckon River near Winchester. 
<a href="#Note_19"><span class="superscript">[19]</span></a>
A few years later they
removed up the Virginia Valley to the Big Lick in the present
Roanoke County, intent upon pushing westward to the very
outskirts of civilization. In the autumn of 1748, leaving behind
his brother William, who had followed him to Roanoke County,
Morgan Bryan removed with his family to the Forks of the Yadkin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
River. 
<a href="#Note_20"><span class="superscript">[20]</span></a>
The Morgans, with the exception of Richard, who emigrated
to Virginia, remained in Pennsylvania, spreading over
Philadelphia and Bucks counties; while the Hanks and Lincoln
families found homes in Virginia&mdash;Mordecai Lincoln's son, John,
the great-grandfather of President Lincoln, removing from Berks
to the Shenandoah Valley in 1765. On May 1, 1750, Squire Boone,
his wife Sarah (Morgan), and their eleven children&mdash;a veritable
caravan, traveling like the patriarchs of old&mdash;started south; and
tarried for a space, according to reliable tradition, on Linville
Creek in the Virginia Valley. In 1752 they removed to the Forks
of the Yadkin, and the following year received from Lord
Granville three tracts of land, all situated in Rowan County.
<a href="#Note_21"><span class="superscript">[21]</span></a>
About the hamlet of Salisbury, which in 1755 consisted of seven
or eight log houses and the court house, there now rapidly
gathered a settlement of people marked by strong individuality,
sturdy independence, and virile self-reliance. The Boones and the
Bryans quickly accommodated themselves to frontier 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
conditions and
immediately began to take an active part in the local affairs of
the county. Upon the organization of the county court Squire
Boone was chosen justice of the peace; and Morgan Bryan was soon
appearing as foreman of juries and director in road improvements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_35_2" id="Page_35_2"></a>
The Great Trading Path, leading from Virginia to the towns of the
Catawbas and other Southern Indians, crossed the Yadkin at the
Trading Ford and passed a mile southeast of Salisbury. Above
Sapona Town near the Trading Ford was Swearing Creek, which,
according to constant and picturesque tradition, was the spot
where the traders stopped to take a solemn oath never to reveal
any unlawful proceedings that might occur during their sojourn
among the Indians. 
<a href="#Note_22"><span class="superscript">[22]</span></a>
In his divertingly satirical "History of the
Dividing Line" William Byrd in 1728 thus speaks of this locality:
"The Soil is exceedingly rich on both sides the Yadkin, abounding
in rank Grass and prodigiously large Trees; and for plenty of
Fish, Fowl and Venison, is inferior to No Part 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
of the Northern
Continent. There the Traders commonly lie Still for some days, to
recruit their Horses' Flesh as well as to recover their own
spirits." In this beautiful country happily chosen for settlement
by Squire Boone&mdash;who erected his cabin on the east side of the
Yadkin about a mile and a quarter from Alleman's, now Boone's,
Ford&mdash;wild game abounded. Buffaloes were encountered in eastern
North Carolina by Byrd while running the dividing line; and in
the upper country of South Carolina three or four men with their
dogs could kill fourteen to twenty buffaloes in a single day.
<a href="#Note_23"><span class="superscript">[23]</span></a>
Deer and bears fell an easy prey to the hunter; wild turkeys
filled every thicket; the watercourses teemed with beaver, otter,
and muskrat, as well as with shad and other delicious fish.
Panthers, wildcats, and wolves overran the country; and the
veracious Brother Joseph, while near the present Wilkesboro,
amusingly records: "The wolves wh. are not like those in Germany,
Poland and Lifland (because they fear men and don't easily come
near) give us such music of six 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
different cornets the like of wh. I have never heard in my life." 
<a href="#Note_24"><span class="superscript">[24]</span></a>
So plentiful was the game that the wild deer mingled with the cattle 
grazing over the wide stretches of luxuriant grass.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of this sylvan paradise grew up Squire Boone's son,
Daniel Boone, a Pennsylvania youth of English stock, Quaker
persuasion, and Baptist proclivities. 
<a href="#Note_25"><span class="superscript">[25]</span></a>
Seen through a glorifying
halo after the lapse of a century and three quarters, he rises
before us a romantic figure, poised and resolute, simple,
benign&mdash;as na&iuml;ve and shy as some wild thing of the primeval
forest&mdash;five feet eight inches in height, with broad chest and
shoulders, dark locks, genial blue eyes arched with fair
eyebrows, thin lips and wide mouth, nose of slightly Roman cast,
and fair, ruddy countenance. Farming was irksome to this
restless, nomadic spirit, who on the slightest excuse would
exchange the plow and the grubbing-hoe for the long rifle and
keen-edged hunting-knife. In a single day during the autumn
season he would kill four or five deer; or as 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
many bears as would make from two to three thousand pounds weight 
of bear-bacon. Fascinated with the forest, he soon found profit as 
well as pleasure in the pursuit of game; and at excellent fixed prices 
he sold his peltries, most often at Salisbury, some thirteen miles
away, sometimes at the store of the old "Dutchman," George
Hartman, on the Yadkin, and occasionally at Bethabara, the
Moravian town sixty-odd miles distant. Skins were in such demand
that they soon came to replace hard money, which was incredibly
scarce in the back country, as a medium of exchange. Upon one
occasion a caravan from Bethabara hauled three thousand pounds,
upon another four thousand pounds, of dressed deerskins to
Charleston. 
<a href="#Note_26"><span class="superscript">[26]</span></a>
So immense was this trade that the year after Boone's
arrival at the Forks of Yadkin thirty thousand deerskins were
exported from the province of North Carolina. We like to think
that the young Daniel Boone was one of that band of whom Brother
Joseph, while in camp on the Catawba River (November 12, 1752)
wrote: "There are many 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
hunters about here, who live like Indians,
they kill many deer selling their hides, and thus live without
much work."
<a href="#Note_27"><span class="superscript">[27]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
In this very class of professional hunters, living like Indians,
was thus bred the spirit of individual initiative and strenuous
leadership in the great westward expansionist movement of the
coming decade. An English traveler gives the following minute
picture of the dress and accoutrement of the Carolina
backwoodsman:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Their whole dress is very singular, and not very materially
different from that of the Indians; being a hunting shirt,
somewhat resembling a waggoner's frock, ornamented with a great
many fringes, tied round the middle with a broad belt, much
decorated also, in which is fastened a tomahawk, an instrument
that serves every purpose of defence and convenience; being a
hammer at one side and a sharp hatchet at the other; the shot bag
and powder-horn, carved with a variety of whimsical figures and
devices, hang from their necks over one shoulder; and on their
heads a flapped hat, of a reddish hue, proceeding from the
intensely hot beams of the sun.
</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
<p>
Sometimes they wear leather breeches, made of Indian dressed elk,
or deer skins, but more frequently thin trowsers.
</p>

<p>
On their legs they have Indian boots, or leggings, made of coarse
woollen cloth, that either are wrapped round loosely and tied
with garters, or laced upon the outside, and always come better
than half-way up the thigh.
</p>

<p>
On their feet they sometimes wear pumps of their own manufacture,
but generally Indian moccossons, of their own construction also,
which are made of strong elk's, or buck's skin, dressed soft as
for gloves or breeches, drawn together in regular plaits over the
toe, and lacing from thence round to the fore part of the middle
of the ancle, without a seam in them, yet fitting close to the
feet, and are indeed perfectly easy and pliant.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_40_2" id="Page_40_2"></a>
Their hunting, or rifle shirts, they have also died in a variety
of colours, some yellow, others red, some brown, and many wear
them quite white.
<a href="#Note_28"><span class="superscript">[28]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
No less unique and bizarre, though less picturesque, was the
dress of the women of the region&mdash;in particular of Surry County,
North Carolina, as described by General William Lenoir:
</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
<p>
The women wore linsey [flax] petticoats and 'bed-gowns' [like a
dressing-sack], and often went without shoes in the summer. Some
had bonnets and bed-gowns made of calico, but generally of linsey;
and some of them wore men's hats. Their hair was commonly
clubbed. Once, at a large meeting, I noticed there but two women
that had on long gowns. One of these was laced genteelly, and the
body of the other was open, and the tail thereof drawn up and
tucked in her apron or coat-string.
<a href="#Note_29"><span class="superscript">[29]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While Daniel Boone was quietly engaged in the pleasant pursuits
of the chase, a vast world-struggle of which he little dreamed
was rapidly approaching a crisis. For three quarters of a century
this titanic contest between France and England for the interior
of the continent had been waged with slowly accumulating force.
The irrepressible conflict had been formally inaugurated at Sault
Ste. Marie in 1671, when Daumont de Saint Lusson, swinging aloft
his sword, proclaimed the sovereignty of France over "all
countries, rivers, lakes, and streams &hellip; both those which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
been discovered and those which may be discovered hereafter, in
all their length and breadth, bounded on the one side by the seas
of the North and of the West, and on the other by the South Sea."
Just three months later, three hardy pioneers of Virginia,
despatched upon their arduous mission by Colonel Abraham Wood in
behalf of the English crown, had crossed the Appalachian divide;
and upon the banks of a stream whose waters slipped into the Ohio
to join the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, had carved the
royal insignia upon the blazed trunk of a giant of the forest,
the while crying: "Long live Charles the Second, by the grace of
God, King of England, Scotland, France, Ireland and Virginia and
of the territories thereunto belonging."
</p>

<p>
La Salle's dream of a New France in the heart of America was
blotted out in his tragic death upon the banks of the River
Trinity (1687). Yet his mantle was to fall in turn upon the
square shoulders of Le Moyne d'Iberville and of his brother&mdash;the
good, the constant Bienville, who after countless and arduous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
struggles laid firm the foundations of New Orleans. In the
precious treasury of Margry we learn that on reaching Rochelle
after his first voyage in 1699 Iberville in these prophetic words
voices his faith: "If France does not immediately seize this part
of America which is the most beautiful, and establish a colony
which is strong enough to resist any which England may have, the
English colonies (already considerable in Carolina) will so
thrive that in less than a hundred years they will be strong
enough to seize all America." 
<a href="#Note_30"><span class="superscript">[30]</span></a>
But the world-weary Louis Quatorze,
nearing his end, quickly tired of that remote and unproductive
colony upon the shores of the gulf, so industriously described in
Paris as a "terrestrial paradise"; and the "paternal providence
of Versailles" willingly yielded place to the monumental
speculation of the great financier Antoine Crozat. In this Paris
of prolific promotion and amazed credulity, ripe for the colossal
scheme of Law, soon to blow to bursting-point the bubble of the
Mississippi, the very songs in the street echoed flamboyant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
half-satiric panegyrics upon the new Utopia, this Mississippi
Land of Cockayne:
</p>

<div class="poem1">
    <p class="poem1">It's to-day no contribution</p>
    <p class="poem1">To discuss the Constitution</p>
    <p class="poem1">And the Spanish war's forgot</p>
		<p class="poem1">For a new Utopian spot;</p>
		<p class="poem1">And the very latest phase</p>
    <p class="poem1">Is the Mississippi craze.
		<a href="#Note_31"><span class="superscript">[31]</span></a></p>
    </div>


<p>
<a name="Page_44_2" id="Page_44_2"></a>
Interest in the new colony led to a great development of
southwesterly trade from New France. Already the French <i>coureurs
de bois</i> were following the water route from the Illinois to South
Carolina. Jean Couture, a deserter from the service in New
France, journeyed over the Ohio and Tennessee rivers to that
colony, and was known as "the greatest Trader and Traveller
amongst the Indians for more than Twenty years." In 1714 young
Charles Charleville accompanied an old trader from Crozat's
colony on the gulf to the great salt-springs on the Cumberland,
where a post for trading with the Shawanoes had already been
established by the French. 
<a href="#Note_32"><span class="superscript">[32]</span></a>
But the British were preparing to
capture this trade 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
as early as 1694, when Tonti warned Villermont
that Carolinians were already established on a branch of the
Ohio. Four years later, Nicholson, Governor of Maryland, was
urging trade with the Indians of the interior in the effort to
displace the French. At an early date the coast colonies began to
trade with the Indian tribes of the back country: the Catawbas of
the Yadkin Valley; the Cherokees, whose towns were scattered
through Tennessee; the Chickasaws, to the westward in northern
Mississippi; and the Choctaws farther to the southward. Even
before the beginning of the eighteenth century, when the South
Carolina settlements extended scarcely twenty miles from the
coast, English traders had established posts among the Indian
tribes four hundred miles to the west of Charleston. Following
the sporadic trading of individuals from Virginia with the inland
Indians, the heavily laden caravans of William Byrd were soon
regularly passing along the Great Trading Path from Virginia to
the towns of the Catawbas and other interior tribes of the
Carolinas, delighting 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
the easily captivated fancy and provoking
the cupidity of the red men with "Guns, Powder, Shot, Hatchets
(which the Indians call Tomahawks), Kettles, red and blue Planes,
Duffields, Stroudwater blankets, and some Cutlary Wares, Brass
Rings and other Trinkets." 
<a href="#Note_33"><span class="superscript">[33]</span></a>
In Pennsylvania, George Croghan, the
guileful diplomat, who was emissary from the Council to the Ohio
Indians (1748), had induced "all-most all the Ingans in the
Woods" to declare against the French; and was described by
Christopher Gist as a "meer idol among his countrymen, the Irish
traders."
</p>

<p>
Against these advances of British trade and civilization, the
French for four decades had artfully struggled, projecting tours
of exploration into the vast medial valley of the continent and
constructing a chain of forts and trading-posts designed to
establish their claims to the country and to hold in check the
threatened English thrust from the east. Soon the wilderness
ambassador of empire, C&eacute;loron de Bienville, was despatched by the
far-visioned 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Galissoni&egrave;re at Quebec to sow broadcast with
ceremonial pomp in the heart of America the seeds of empire,
grandiosely graven plates of lasting lead, in defiant yet futile
symbol of the asserted sovereignty of France. Thus threatened in
the vindication of the rights of their colonial sea-to-sea
charters, the English threw off the lethargy with which they had
failed to protect their traders, and in grants to the Ohio and
Loyal land companies began resolutely to form plans looking to
the occupation of the interior. But the French seized the English
trading-house at Venango which they converted into a fort; and
Virginia's protest, conveyed by a calm and judicious young man, a
surveyor, George Washington, availed not to prevent the French
from seizing Captain Trent's hastily erected military post at the
forks of the Ohio and constructing there a formidable work, named
Fort Duquesne. Washington, with his expeditionary force sent to
garrison Captain Trent's fort, defeated Jumonville and his small
force near Great 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Meadows (May, 1754); but soon after he was
forced to surrender Fort Necessity to Coulon de Villiers.
</p>

<p>
The titanic struggle, fittingly precipitated in the backwoods of
the Old Southwest, was now on&mdash;a struggle in which the resolute
pioneers of these backwoods first seriously measured their
strength with the French and their copper-hued allies, and
learned to surpass the latter in their own mode of warfare. The
portentous conflict, destined to assure the eastern half of the
continent to Great Britain, is a grim, prophetic harbinger of the
mighty movement of the next quarter of a century into the
twilight zone of the trans-Alleghany territory.

before the actual outbreak of hostilities 
powerful forces were gradually converging to produce a clash between the
aggressive colonials and the crafty Indians. As the settlers
pressed farther westward into the domain of the red men,
arrogantly grazing their stock over the cherished hunting-grounds
of the Cherokees, the savages, who were already well disposed
toward the French, began to manifest a deep indignation against
the British colonists because of this callous encroachment upon
their territory. During the sporadic forays by scattered bands of
Northern Indians 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
upon the Catawbas and other tribes friendly to
the pioneers the isolated settlements at the back part of the
Carolinas suffered rude and sanguinary onslaughts. In the summer
of 1753 a party of northern Indians warring in the French
interest made their appearance in Rowan County, which had just
been organized, and committed various depredations upon the
scattered settlements. To repel these attacks a band of the
Catawbas sallied forth, encountered a detached party of the
enemy, and slew five of their number. Among the spoils,
significantly enough, were silver crucifixes, beads,

Intense rivalry for the good will of the near-by southern tribes
existed between Virginia and South Carolina. In strong
remonstrance against the alleged attempt of Governor Dinwiddie of
Virginia to alienate the Cherokees, Catawbas, Muscogees, and
Chickasaws from South Carolina and to attach them to Virginia,
Governor Glen of South Carolina made pungent observations to
Dinwiddie: 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
"South Carolina is a weak frontier colony, and in case
of invasion by the French would be their first object of attack.
We have not much to fear, however, while we retain the affection
of the Indians around us; but should we forfeit that by any
mismanagement on our part, or by the superior address of the
French, we are in a miserable situation. The Cherokees alone have
several thousand gunmen well acquainted with every inch of the
province &hellip; their country is the key to Carolina." By a treaty
concluded at Saluda (November 24, 1753), Glen promised to build
the Cherokees a fort near the lower towns, for the protection of
themselves and their allies; and the Cherokees on their part
agreed to become the subjects of the King of Great Britain and
hold their lands under him. 
<a href="#Note_35"><span class="superscript">[35]</span></a>
This fort, erected this same year on
the headwaters of the Savannah, within gunshot distance of the
important Indian town of Keowee, was named Fort Prince George.
"It is a square," says the founder of the fort (Governor Glen to
the Board of Trade, August 26, 1754), "with regular Bastions and
four Ravelins 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
it is near Two hundred foot from Salient Angle to
Salient Angle and is made of Earth taken out of the Ditch,
secured with fachines and well rammed with a banquet on the
Inside for the men to stand upon when they fire over, the
Ravelins are made of Posts of Lightwood which is very durable,
they are ten foot in length sharp pointed three foot and a half
in the ground." 
<a href="#Note_36"><span class="superscript">[36]</span></a>
The dire need for such a fort in the back country
was tragically illustrated by the sudden onslaught upon the
"House of John Gutry &amp; James Anshers" in York County by a party
of sixty French Indians (December 16, 1754), who brutally
murdered sixteen of the twenty-one persons present, and carried
off as captives the remaining five.
<a href="#Note_37"><span class="superscript">[37]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
At the outbreak of the French and Indian War in 1754 North
Carolina voted twelve thousand pounds for the raising of troops
and several thousand pounds additional for the construction of
forts&mdash;a sum considerably larger than that voted by Virginia. A
regiment of two hundred and fifty men was placed 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
under the
command of Colonel James Innes of the Cape Fear section; and the
ablest officer under him was the young Irishman from the same
section, Lieutenant Hugh Waddell. On June 3, 1754, Dinwiddie
appointed Innes, his close friend, commander-in-chief of all the
forces against the French; and immediately after the disaster at
Great Meadows (July, 1754), Innes took command. Within two months
the supplies for the North Carolina troops were exhausted; and as
Virginia then failed to furnish additional supplies, Colonel
Innes had no recourse but to disband his troops and permit them
to return home. Appointed governor of Fort Cumberland by General
Braddock, he was in command there while Braddock advanced on his
disastrous march.
</p>

<p>
The lesson of Braddock's defeat (July 9, 1755) was memorable in
the history of the Old Southwest. Well might Braddock exclaim
with his last breath: "Who would have thought it? &hellip; We shall
know better how to deal with them another time." Led on by the
reckless and fiery Beaujeu, wearing an Indian 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
gorget about his
neck, the savages from the protection of trees and rough
defenses, a prepared ambuscade, poured a galling fire into the
compact divisions of the English, whose scarlet coats furnished
ideal targets. The obstinacy of the British commanders in
refusing to permit their troops to fight Indian fashion was
suicidal; for as Herman Alrichs wrote Governor Morris of
Pennsylvania (July 22, 1755): "&hellip; the French and Indians had
cast an Intrenchment across the road before our Army which they
Discovered not Untill the [y] came Close up to it, from thence and
both sides of the road the enemy kept a constant fireing on them,
our Army being so confused, they could not fight, and they would
not be admitted by the Gen<span class="superscript">l</span> or 
Sir John St. Clair, to break thro' their Ranks and Take behind 
trees." 
<a href="#Note_38"><span class="superscript">[38]</span></a>
Daniel Boone, who went from North Carolina as a wagoner 
in the company commanded by Edward Brice Dobbs, was on the 
battle-field; but Dobbs's company at the time was scouting in 
the woods. When the fierce attack fell upon the baggage train,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> 
Boone succeeded in effecting his escape only
by cutting the traces of his team and fleeing on one of the
horses. To his dying day Boone continued to censure Braddock's
conduct, and reprehended especially his fatal neglect to employ
strong flank-guards and a sufficient number of Provincial scouts
thoroughly acquainted with the wilderness and all the wiles and
strategies of savage warfare.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_55_2" id="Page_55_2"></a>
For a number of months following Braddock's defeat there was a
great rush of the frightened people southward. In a letter to
Dinwiddie, Washington expresses the apprehension that Augusta,
Frederick, and Hampshire County will soon be depopulated, as the
whole back country is in motion toward the southern colonies.
During this same summer Governor Arthur Dobbs of North Carolina
made a tour of exploration through the western part of the
colony, seeking a site for a fort to guard the frontier. 
<a href="#Note_39"><span class="superscript">[39]</span></a>
The
frontier company of fifty men which was to garrison the projected
fort was placed under the command of Hugh Waddell, now promoted
to the rank 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span> 
of captain, though only twenty-one years old. In
addition to Waddell's company, armed patrols were required for
the protection of the Rowan County frontier; and during the
summer Indian alarms were frequent at the Moravian village of
Bethabara, whose inhabitants had heard with distress on March
31st of the slaughter of eleven Moravians on the Mahoni and of
the ruin of Gnadenh&uuml;tten. Many of the settlers in the outlying
districts of Rowan fled for safety to the refuge of the little
village; and frequently every available house, every place of
temporary abode was filled with panic-stricken refugees. So
persistent were the depredations of the Indians and so alarmed
were the scattered Rowan settlers by the news of the murders and
the destruction of Vaux's Fort in Virginia (June 25, 1756) that
at a conference on July 5th the Moravians "decided to protect our
houses with palisades, and make them safe before the enemy should
invade our tract or attack us, for if the people were all going
to retreat we would be the last left on the frontier and the
first point of attack." 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span> 
By July 23d, they had constructed a
strong defense for their settlement, afterward called the "Dutch
Fort" by the Indians. The principal structure was a stockade,
triangular in plan, some three hundred feet on a side, enclosing
the principal buildings of the settlement; and the gateway was
guarded by an observation tower. The other defense was a stockade
embracing eight houses at the mill some distance away, around
which a small settlement had sprung up.
<a href="#Note_40"><span class="superscript">[40]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
During the same year the fort planned by Dobbs was erected upon
the site he had chosen&mdash;between Third and Fourth creeks; and the
commissioners Richard Caswell and Francis Brown, sent out to
inspect the fort, made the following picturesque report to the
Assembly (December 21, 1756):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
That they had likewise viewed the State of Fort Dobbs, and found
it to be a good and Substantial Building of the Dimentions

Soldiers Appearing well and in good Spirits.
<a href="#Note_41"><span class="superscript">[41]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As to the erection of a fort on the Tennessee, promised the
Cherokees by South Carolina, difficulties between the governor of
that province and of Virginia in regard to matters of policy and
the proportionate share of expenses made effective co&ouml;peration
between the two colonies well-nigh impossible. Glen, as we have
seen, had resented Dinwiddie's efforts to win the South Carolina
Indians over to Virginia's interest. And Dinwiddie had been very
indignant when the force promised him by the Indians to aid
General Braddock did not arrive, attributing this defection in
part 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span> 
to Glen's negotiations for a meeting with the chieftains and
in part to the influence of the South Carolina traders, who kept
the Indians away by hiring them to go on long hunts for furs and
skins. But there was no such contention between Virginia and
North Carolina. Dinwiddie and Dobbs arranged (November 6, 1755)
to send a commission from these colonies to treat with the
Cherokees and the Catawbas. Virginia sent two commissioners,
Colonel William Byrd, third of that name, and Colonel Peter
Randolph; while North Carolina sent one, Captain Hugh Waddell.
Salisbury, North Carolina, was the place of rendezvous. The
treaty with the Catawbas was made at the Catawba Town, presumably
the village opposite the mouth of Sugaw Creek, in York County,
South Carolina, on February 20-21, 1756; that with the Cherokees
on Broad River, North Carolina, March 13-17. As a result of the
negotiations and after the receipt of a present of goods, the
Catawbas agreed to send forty warriors to aid Virginia within
forty days; and the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span> 
Cherokees, in return for presents and
Virginia's promise to contribute her proportion toward the
erection of a strong fort, undertook to send four hundred
warriors within forty days, "as soon as the said fort shall be
built." Virginia and North Carolina thus wisely co&ouml;perated to
"straighten the path" and "brighten the chain" between the white
and the red men, in important treaties which have largely escaped
the attention of historians.
<a href="#Note_42"><span class="superscript">[42]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
On May 25, 1756, a conference was held at Salisbury between King
Heygler and warriors of the Catawba nation on the one side and
Chief Justice Henley, doubtless attended by Captain Waddell and
his frontier company, on the other. King Heygler, following the
lead set by the Cherokees, petitioned the Governor of North
Carolina to send the Catawbas some ammunition and to "build us a
fort for securing our old men, women and children when we turn
out to fight the Enemy on their coming." The chief justice
assured the King that the Catawbas would receive a necessary
supply of ammunition (one hundred pounds of 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span> 
gunpowder and four
hundred pounds of lead were later sent them) and promised to urge
with the governor their request to have a fort built as soon as
possible. Pathos not unmixed with dry humor tinges the eloquent
appeal of good old King Heygler, ever the loyal friend of the
whites, at this conference:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Page_61_2" id="Page_61_2"></a>
I desire a stop may be put to the selling of strong Liquors by
the White people to my people especially near the Indian nation.
<em>If the White people make strong drink, let them sell it to one 
another, or drink it in their own families.</em> This will avoid a
great deal of mischief which otherwise will happen from my
people getting drunk and quarrelling with the White people. I
have no strong prisons like you to confine them for it. Our only
way is to put them under ground and all these (pointing proudly
to his Warriors) will be ready to do that to those who shall
deserve it.
<a href="#Note_43"><span class="superscript">[43]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In response to this request, the sum of four thousand pounds was
appropriated by the North Carolina Assembly for the erection of
"a Fort on our western frontier to protect and secure the
Catawbas" and for the support of two 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
companies of fifty men each 
to garrison this and another fort building on the sea coast. The
commissioners appointed for the purpose recommended (December 21,
1756) a site for the fort "near the Catawba nation"; and on
January 20, 1757, Governor Dobbs reported: "We are now building
a Fort in the midst of their towns at their own Request." The
fort thereupon begun must have stood near the mouth of the South
Fork of the Catawba River, as Dobbs says it was in the "midst" of
their towns, which are situated a "few miles north and south of
38&deg;" and might properly be included within a circle of
thirty miles radius.
<a href="#Note_44"><span class="superscript">[44]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
During the succeeding months many depredations were committed by
the Indians upon the exposed and scattered settlements. Had it
not been for the protection afforded by all these forts, by the
militia companies under Alexander Osborne of Rowan and Nathaniel
Alexander of Anson, and by a special company of patrollers under
Green and Moore, the back 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> 
settlers who had been so outrageously
"pilfered" by the Indians would have "retired from the Frontier
into the inner settlements."

<span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">ith</span> 
commendable energy and expedition 
Dinwiddie and Dobbs, acting in concert, initiated steps for keeping 
the engagements conjointly made by the two colonies with the Cherokees 
and the Catawbas in the spring and summer of 1756. Enlisting sixty men,
"most of them Artificers, with Tools and Provisions," Major
Andrew Lewis proceeded in the late spring to Echota in the
Cherokee country. Here during the hot summer months they erected
the Virginia Fort on the path from Virginia, upon the northern
bank 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
of the Little Tennessee, nearly opposite the Indian town of
Echota and about twenty-five miles southwest of Knoxville. 
<a href="#Note_46"><span class="superscript">[46]</span></a>
While
the fort was in process of construction, the Cherokees were
incessantly tampered with by emissaries from the Nuntewees and
the Savannahs in the French interest, and from the French
themselves at the Alibamu Fort. So effective were these
machinations, supported by extravagant promises and doubtless
rich bribes, that the Cherokees soon were outspokenly expressing
their desire for a French fort at Great Tellico.
</p>

<p>
Dinwiddie welcomed the departure from America of Governor Glen of
South Carolina, who in his opinion had always acted contrary to
the king's interest. From the new governor, William Henry
Lyttelton, who arrived in Charleston on June 1, 1756, he hoped to
secure effective co&ouml;peration in dealing with the Cherokees and
the Catawbas. This hope was based upon Lyttelton's recognition,
as stated in Dinwiddie's words, of the "Necessity of strict Union
between the whole Colonies, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
with't any of them considering their
particular Interest separate from the general Good of the whole."
After constructing the fort "with't the least assistance from
South Carolina," Major Lewis happened by accident upon a grand
council being held in Echota in September. At that time he
discovered to his great alarm that the machinations of the French
had already produced the greatest imaginable change in the
sentiment of the Cherokees. Captain Raymond Demere of the
Provincials, with two hundred English troops, had arrived to
garrison the fort; but the head men of all the Upper Towns were
secretly influenced to agree to write a letter to Captain Demere,
ordering him to return immediately to Charleston with all the
troops under his command. At the grand council, Atta-kulla-kulla,
the great Cherokee chieftain, passionately declared to the head
men, who listened approvingly, that "as to the few soldiers of
Captain Demere that was there, he would take their Guns, and give
them to his young men to hunt with and as to their clothes they
would 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
soon be worn out and their skins would be tanned, and be of
the same colour as theirs, and that they should live among them
as slaves." With impressive dignity Major Lewis rose and
earnestly pleaded for the observance of the terms of the treaty
solemnly negotiated the preceding March. In response, the crafty
and treacherous chieftains desired Lewis to tell the Governor of
Virginia that "they had taken up the Hatchet against all Nations
that were Enemies to the English"; but Lewis, an astute student
of Indian Psychology, rightly surmised that all their glib
professions of friendship and assistance were "only to put a
gloss on their knavery." 
<a href="#Note_47"><span class="superscript">[47]</span></a>
So it proved; for instead of the four
hundred warriors promised under the treaty for service in
Virginia, the Cherokees sent only seven warriors, accompanied by
three women. Although the Cherokees petitioned Virginia for a
number of men to garrison the Virginia fort, Dinwiddie postponed
sending the fifty men provided for by the Virginia Assembly until
he could reassure himself in regard to the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
"Behaviour and
Intention" of the treacherous Indian allies. This proved to be a
prudent decision; for not long after its erection the Virginia
fort was destroyed by the Indians.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_68_2" id="Page_68_2"></a>
Whether on account of the dissatisfaction expressed by the
Cherokees over the erection of the Virginia fort or because of a
recognition of the mistaken policy of garrisoning a work erected
by Virginia with troops sent from Charleston, South Carolina
immediately proceeded to build another stronghold on the southern
bank of the Tennessee at the mouth of Tellico River, some seven
miles from the site of the Virginia fort; and here were posted
twelve great guns, brought thither at immense labor through the
wilderness. 
<a href="#Note_48"><span class="superscript">[48]</span></a>
To this fort, named Fort Loudoun in honor of Lord
Loudoun, then commander-in-chief of all the English forces in
America, the Indians allured artisans by donations of land; and
during the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
next three or four years a little settlement sprang up
there.
</p>

<p>
The frontiers of Virginia suffered most from the incursions of
hostile Indians during the fourteen months following May 1, 1755.
In July, the Rev. Hugh McAden records that he preached in
Virginia on a day set apart for fasting and prayer "on account of
the wars and many murders, committed by the savage Indians on the
back inhabitants." On July 30th a large party of Shawano Indians
fell upon the New River settlement and wiped it out of existence.
William Ingles was absent at the time of the raid; and Mrs.
Ingles, who was captured, afterward effected her escape. 
<a href="#Note_49"><span class="superscript">[49]</span></a>
The
following summer (June 25, 1756), Fort Vaux on the headwaters of
the Roanoke, under the command of Captain John Smith, was
captured by about one hundred French and Indians, who burnt the
fort, killed John Smith junior, John Robinson, John Tracey and
John Ingles, wounded four men, and captured twenty-two men,
women, and children. Among the captured was the famous Mrs. Mary
Ingles, whose husband, John Ingles, was killed; but after being
"carried away into Captivity, amongst whom she was barbarously
treated," according to her own statement, she 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
finally escaped and returned to Virginia. 
<a href="#Note_50"><span class="superscript">[50]</span></a>
The frontier continued to be 
infested by marauding bands of French and Indians; and Dinwiddie gloomily
confessed to Dobbs (July 22d): "I apprehend that we shall always
be harrass'd with fly'g Parties of these Banditti unless we form
an Expedit'n ag'st them, to attack 'em in y'r Towns." 
<a href="#Note_51"><span class="superscript">[51]</span></a>
Such an
expedition, known as the Sandy River Expedition, had been sent
out in February to avenge the massacre of the New River settlers;
but the enterprise engaged in by about four hundred Virginians
and Cherokees under Major Andrew Lewis and Captain Richard
Pearis, proved a disastrous failure. Not a single Indian was
seen; and the party suffered extraordinary hardships and narrowly
escaped starvation.
<a href="#Note_52"><span class="superscript">[52]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
In conformity with his treaty obligations with the Catawbas,
Governor Dobbs commissioned Captain Hugh Waddell to erect the
fort promised the Catawbas at the spot chosen by the
commissioners near the mouth of the South Fork of the Catawba
River. This fort, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
for which four thousand pounds had been
appropriated, was for the most part completed by midsummer, 1757.
But owing, it appears, both to the machinations of the French and
to the intermeddling of the South Carolina traders, who desired
to retain the trade of the Catawbas for that province, Oroloswa,
the Catawba King Heygler, sent a "talk" to Governor Lyttelton,
requesting that North Carolina desist from the work of
construction and that no fort be built except by South Carolina.
Accordingly, Governor Dobbs ordered Captain Waddell to discharge
the workmen (August 11, 1757); 
<a href="#Note_53"><span class="superscript">[53]</span></a>
and every effort was made for many
months thereafter to conciliate the Catawbas, erstwhile friends
of North Carolina. The Catawba fort erected by North Carolina was
never fully completed; and several years later South Carolina,
having succeeded in alienating the Catawbas from North Carolina,
which colony had given them the best possible treatment, built
for them a fort 
<a href="#Note_54"><span class="superscript">[54]</span></a>
at the mouth of Line Creek on the east bank of
the Catawba River.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
In the spring and summer of 1757 the long-expected Indian allies
arrived in Virginia, as many as four hundred by May&mdash;Cherokees,
Catawbas, Tuscaroras, and Nottaways. But Dinwiddie was wholly
unable to use them effectively; and in order to provide amusement
for them, he directed that they should go "a scalping" with the
whites&mdash;"a barbarous method of war," frankly acknowledged the
governor, "introduced by the French, which we are oblidged to
follow in our own defense." Most of the Indian allies
discontentedly returned home before the end of the year, but the
remainder waited until the next year, to take part in the
campaign against Fort Duquesne. Three North Carolina companies,
composed of trained soldiers and hardy frontiersmen, went through
this campaign under the command of Major Hugh Waddell, the
"Washington of North Carolina." Long of limb and broad of chest,
powerful, lithe, and active, Waddell was an ideal leader for this
arduous service, being fertile in expedient and skilful in the
employment of Indian tactics. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
With true provincial pride Governor
Dobbs records that Waddell "had great honor done him, being
employed in all reconnoitring parties, and dressed and acted as
an Indian; and his sergeant, Rogers, took the only Indian
prisoner, who gave Mr. Forbes certain intelligence of the forces
in Fort Duquesne, upon which they resolved to proceed." This
apparently trivial incident is remarkable, in that it proved to
be the decisive factor in a campaign that was about to be
abandoned. The information in regard to the state of the garrison
at Fort Duquesne, secured from the Indian, for the capture of
whom two leading officers had offered a reward of two hundred and
fifty pounds, emboldened Forbes to advance rather than to retire.
Upon reaching the fort (November 25th), he found it abandoned by
the enemy. Sergeant Rogers never received the reward promised by
General Forbes and the other English officer; but some time
afterward he was compensated by a modest sum from the colony of
North Carolina.
<a href="#Note_55"><span class="superscript">[55]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
A series of unfortunate occurrences, chiefly 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the fault of the whites, soon resulted in the precipitation of a 
terrible Indian outbreak. A party of Cherokees, returning home in 
May, 1758, seized some stray horses on the frontier of 
Virginia&mdash;never dreaming of any wrong, says an old historian, 
as they saw it frequently done by the whites. The owners of the 
horses, hastily forming a party, went in pursuit of the Indians and 
killed twelve or fourteen of the number. The relatives of the slain 
Indians, greatly incensed, vowed vengeance upon the whites. 
<a href="#Note_56"><span class="superscript">[56]</span></a>
Nor was the
tactless conduct of Forbes calculated to quiet this resentment;
for when Atta-kulla-kulla and nine other chieftains deserted in
disgust at the treatment accorded them, they were pursued by
Forbes's orders, apprehended and disarmed. 
<a href="#Note_57"><span class="superscript">[57]</span></a>
This rude treatment,
coupled with the brutal and wanton murder of some Cherokee
hunters a little earlier, by an irresponsible band of Virginians
under Captain Robert Wade, still further aggravated the Indians.
<a href="#Note_58"><span class="superscript">[58]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Incited by the French, who had fled to the southward after the
fall of Fort Duquesne, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
parties of bloodthirsty young Indians
rushed down upon the settlements and left in their path death and
desolation along the frontiers of the Carolinas. 
<a href="#Note_59"><span class="superscript">[59]</span></a>
On the upper
branch of the Yadkin and below the South Yadkin near Fort Dobbs
twenty-two whites fell in swift succession before the secret
onslaughts of the savages from the lower Cherokee towns. 
<a href="#Note_60"><span class="superscript">[60]</span></a>
Many of
the settlers along the Yadkin fled to the Carolina Fort at
Bethabara and the stockade at the mill; and the sheriff of Rowan
County suffered siege by the Cherokees, in his home, until
rescued by a detachment under Brother Loesch from Bethabara.
While many families took refuge in Fort Dobbs, frontiersmen under
Captain Morgan Bryan ranged through the mountains to the west of
Salisbury and guarded the settlements from the hostile incursions
of the savages. So gravely alarmed were the Rowan settlers,
compelled by the Indians to desert their planting and crops, that
Colonel Harris was despatched post-haste for aid to Cape Fear,
arriving there on July 1st. With strenuous energy 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Captain Waddell, then stationed in the east, rushed two companies 
of thirty men each to the rescue, sending by water-carriage six
swivel guns and ammunition on before him; and these
reinforcements brought relief at last to the harassed Rowan
frontiers.
<a href="#Note_61"><span class="superscript">[61]</span></a>
During the remainder of the year, the borders were kept clear by bold 
and tireless rangers&mdash;under the leadership of expert Indian 
fighters of the stamp of Griffith Rutherford and Morgan Bryan.
</p>

<p>
When the Cherokee warriors who had wrought havoc along the North
Carolina border in April arrived at their town of Settiquo, they
proudly displayed the twenty-two scalps of the slain Rowan
settlers. Upon the demand for these scalps by Captain Demere at
Fort Loudon and under direction of Atta-kulla-kulla, the Settiquo
warriors surrendered eleven of the scalps to Captain Demere who,
according to custom in time of peace, buried them. New murders on
Pacolet and along the Virginia Path, which occurred shortly
afterward, caused gloomy forebodings; and it 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
was plain, says a contemporary gazette, that "the lower Cherokees 
were not satisfied with the murder of the Rowan settlers, but 
intended further mischief." 
<a href="#Note_62"><span class="superscript">[62]</span></a>
On October 1st and again on October 31st,
Governor Dobbs received urgent requests from Governor Lyttelton,
asking that the North Carolina provincials and militia co&ouml;perate
to bring him assistance. Although there was no law requiring the
troops to march out of the province and the exposed frontiers of
North Carolina sorely needed protection, Waddell, now
commissioned colonel, assembled a force of five small companies
and marched to the aid of Governor Lyttelton. But early in
January, 1760, while on the march, Waddell received a letter from
Lyttelton, informing him that the assistance was not needed and
that a treaty of peace had been negotiated with the Cherokees.

<span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="smcap">overnor Lyttelton's</span> 
treaty of "peace," negotiated with the Cherokees at the close 
of 1759, was worse than a crime: it was a crass and hideous blunder. 
His domineering attitude and tyrannical treatment of these Indians 
had aroused the bitterest animosity. Yet he did not realize that 
it was no longer safe to trust their word. No sooner did the 
governor withdraw his army from the borders than the cunning 
Cherokees, whose passions had been inflamed by what may fairly 
be called the treacherous conduct of Lyttelton, rushed down 
with merciless ferocity upon the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
innocent and defenseless families on the frontier. On February 1, 
1760, while a large party (including the family of Patrick Calhoun), 
numbering in all about one hundred and fifty persons, were removing 
from the Long Cane settlement to Augusta, they were suddenly 
attacked by a hundred mounted Cherokees, who slaughtered about 
fifty of them. After the massacre, many of the children were found 
helplessly wandering in the woods. One man alone carried to Augusta 
no less than nine of the pitiful innocents, some horribly mutilated 
with the tomahawk, others scalped, and all yet alive.
</p>

<p>
Atrocities defying description continued to be committed, and
many people were slain. The Cherokees, under the leadership of
Si-lou-ee, or the Young Warrior of Estatoe, the Round O, Tiftoe,
and others, were baffled in their persistent efforts to capture
Fort Prince George. On February 16th the crafty Oconostota
appeared before the fort and under the pretext of desiring some
white man to accompany him on a visit to the governor on urgent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
business, lured the commander, Lieutenant Coytomore, and two
attendants to a conference outside the gates. At a preconceived
signal a volley of shots rang out; the two attendants were
wounded, and Lieutenant Coytomore, riddled with bullets, fell
dead. Enraged by this act of treachery, the garrison put to death
the Indian hostages within. During the abortive attack upon the
fort, Oconostota, unaware of the murder of the hostages, was
heard shouting above the din of battle: "Fight strong, and you
shall be relieved."
<a href="#Note_64"><span class="superscript">[64]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Now began the dark days along the Rowan border, which were so
sorely to test human endurance. Many refugees fortified
themselves in the different stockades; and Colonel Hugh Waddell
with his redoubtable frontier company of Indian-fighters awaited
the onslaught of the savages, who were reported to have passed
through the mountain defiles and to be approaching along the
foot-hills. The story of the investment of Fort Dobbs and the
splendidly daring sortie of Waddell and Bailey is 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
best told in
Waddell's report to Governor Dobbs (February 29, 1760):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For several Days I observed a small party of Indians were
constantly about the fort, I sent out several parties after them
to no purpose, the Evening before last between 8 &amp; 9 o'clock I
found by the Dogs making an uncommon Noise there must be a party
nigh a Spring which we sometimes use. As my Garrison is but
small, and I was apprehensive it might be a scheme to draw out
the Garrison, I took our Capt. Bailie who with myself and party
made up ten: We had not marched 300 yds. from the fort when we
were attacked by at least 60 or 70 Indians. I had given my party
Orders not to fire until I gave the word, which they punctually
observed: We recd the Indians' fire: When I perceived they had
almost all fired, I ordered my party to fire which We did not
further than 12 steps each loaded with a Bullet and 7 Buck Shot,
they had nothing to cover them as they were advancing either to
tomahawk us or make us Prisoners: They found the fire very hot
from so small a Number which a good deal confused them: I then
ordered my party to retreat, as I found the Instant our skirmish
began another party had attacked the fort, upon our reinforcing
the garrison the Indians were soon 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
repulsed with I am sure a
considerable Loss, from what I myself saw as well as those I can
confide in they cou'd not have less than 10 or 12 killed and
wounded; The next Morning we found a great deal of Blood and one
dead whom I suppose they cou'd not find in the night. On my side
I had 2 Men wounded one of whom I am afraid will die as he is
scalped, the other is in way of Recovery, and one boy killed near
the fort whom they durst not advance to scalp. I expected they
would have paid me another visit last night, as they attack all
Fortifications by Night, but find they did not like their
Reception.
<a href="#Note_65"><span class="superscript">[65]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Page_82_2" id="Page_82_2"></a>
Alarmed by Waddell's "offensive-defensive," the Indians abandoned
the siege. Robert Campbell, Waddell's ranger, who was scalped in
this engagement, subsequently recovered from his wounds and was
recompensed by the colony with the sum of twenty pounds.
<a href="#Note_66"><span class="superscript">[66]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
In addition to the frontier militia, four independent companies
were now placed under Waddell's command. Companies of volunteers
scoured the woods in search of the lurking Indian foe. These
rangers, who were clad in hunting-shirts and buckskin leggings,
and who 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
employed Indian tactics in fighting, were captained by
such hardy leaders as the veteran Morgan Bryan, the intrepid
Griffith Rutherford, the German partisan, Martin Phifer
(Pfeiffer), and Anthony Hampton, the father of General Wade
Hampton. They visited periodically a chain of "forest castles"
erected by the settlers&mdash;extending all the way from Fort Dobbs
and the Moravian fortifications in the Wachau to Samuel
Stalnaker's stockade on the Middle Fork of the Holston in
Virginia. About the middle of March, thirty volunteer Rowan
County rangers encountered a band of forty Cherokees, who
fortified themselves in a deserted house near the Catawba River.
The famous scout and hunter, John Perkins, assisted by one of his
bolder companions, crept up to the house and flung lighted
torches upon the roof. One of the Indians, as the smoke became
suffocating and the flames burned hotter, exclaimed: "Better for
one to die bravely than for all to perish miserably in the
flames," and darting forth, dashed rapidly hither and thither, in
order to 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
draw as many shots as possible. This act of superb
self-sacrifice was successful; and while the rifles of the
whites, who riddled the brave Indian with balls, were empty, the
other savages made a wild dash for liberty. Seven fell thus under
the deadly rain of bullets; but many escaped. Ten of the Indians,
all told, lost their scalps, for which the volunteer rangers were
subsequently paid one hundred pounds by the colony of North
Carolina.
<a href="#Note_67"><span class="superscript">[67]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Beaten back from Fort Dobbs, sorely defeated along the Catawba,
hotly pursued by the rangers, the Cherokees continued to lurk in
the shadows of the dense forests, and at every opportunity to
fall suddenly upon wayfaring settlers and isolated cabins remote
from any stronghold. On March 8th William Fish, his son, and
Thompson, a companion, were riding along the "trace," in search
of provisions for a group of families fortified on the Yadkin,
when a flight of arrows hurtled from the cane-brake, and Fish and
his son fell dead. Although pierced with two arrows, one in the
hip and one clean through his body, Thompson 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
escaped upon his
fleet horse; and after a night of ghastly suffering finally
reached the Carolina Fort at Bethabara. The good Dr. Bonn, by
skilfully extracting the barbed shafts from his body, saved
Thompson's life. The pious Moravians rejoiced over the recovery
of the brave messenger, whose sensational arrival gave them
timely warning of the close proximity of the Indians. While
feeding their cattle, settlers were shot from ambush by the
lurking foe; and on March 11th, a family barricaded within a
burning house, which they were defending with desperate courage,
were rescued in the nick of time by the militia. No episode from
Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales surpasses in melancholy
interest Harry Hicks's heroic defense of his little fort on Bean
Island Creek. Surrounded by the Indians, Hicks and his family
took refuge within the small outer palisade around his humble
home. Fighting desperately against terrific odds, he was finally
driven from his yard into his log cabin, which he continued to
defend with dauntless courage. With 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
every shot he tried to send a
redskin to the happy hunting-grounds; and it was only after his
powder was exhausted that he fell, fighting to the last, beneath
the deadly tomahawk. So impressed were the Indians by his bravery
that they spared the life of his wife and his little son; and
these were afterward rescued by Waddell when he marched to the
Cherokee towns in 1761.
<a href="#Note_68"><span class="superscript">[68]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The kindly Moravians had always entertained with generous
hospitality the roving bands of Cherokees, who accordingly held
them in much esteem and spoke of Bethabara as "the Dutch Fort,
where there are good people and much bread." But now, in these
dread days, the truth of their daily text was brought forcibly
home to the Moravians: "Neither Nehemiah nor his brethren put off
their clothes, but prayed as they watched." With Bible in one
hand and rifle in the other, the inhabitant of Wachovia sternly
marched to religious worship. No Puritan of bleak New England
ever showed more resolute courage or greater will to defend the
hard-won 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
outpost of civilization than did the pious Moravian of
the Wachau. At the new settlement of Bethania on Easter Day, more
than four hundred souls, including sixty rangers, listened
devoutly to the eloquent sermon of Bishop Spangenberg concerning
the way of salvation&mdash;the while their arms, stacked without the
<i>Gemein Haus</i>, were guarded by the watchful sentinel. On March 14th
the watchmen at Bethania with well-aimed shots repelled the
Indians, whose hideous yells of baffled rage sounded down the
wind like "the howling of a hundred wolves." Religion was no
protection against the savages; for three ministers journeying to
the present site of Salem were set upon by the red men&mdash;one
escaping, another suffering capture, and the third, a Baptist,
losing his life. A little later word came to Fort Dobbs that John
Long and Robert Gillespie of Salisbury had been shot from ambush
and scalped&mdash;Long having been pierced with eight bullets and
Gillespie with seven.
<a href="#Note_69"><span class="superscript">[69]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
There is one beautiful incident recorded by the Moravians, which
has a truly symbolic 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
significance. While the war was at its
height, a strong party of Cherokees, who had lost their chief,
planned in retaliation to attack Bethabara. "When they went
home," sets forth the Moravian Diary, "they said they had been to
a great town, where there were a great many people, where the
bells rang often, and during the night, time after time, a horn
was blown, so that they feared to attack the town and had taken
no prisoners." The trumpet of the watchman, announcing the
passing of the hour, had convinced the Indians that their plans
for attack were discovered; and the regular evening bell,
summoning the pious to prayer, rang in the stricken ears of the
red men like the clamant call to arms.
</p>

<p>
Following the retirement from office of Governor Lyttelton,
Lieutenant-Governor Bull proceeded to prosecute the war with
vigor. On April 1, 1760, twelve hundred men under Colonel
Archibald Montgomerie arrived at Charleston, with instructions to
strike an immediate blow and to relieve Fort Loudon, then
invested by the Cherokees. With his own 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
force, two hundred and
ninety-five South Carolina Rangers, forty picked men of the new
"levies," and "a good number of guides," Montgomerie moved from
Fort Ninety-Six on May 28th. On the first of June, crossing
Twelve-Mile River, Montgomerie began the campaign in earnest,
devastating and burning every Indian village in the Valley of
Keowee, killing and capturing more than a hundred of the
Cherokees, and destroying immense stores of corn. Receiving no
reply to his summons to the Cherokees of the Middle and Upper
Towns to make peace or suffer like treatment, Montgomerie took up
his march from Fort Prince George on June 24th, resolved to carry
out his threat. On the morning of the 27th, he was drawn into an
ambuscade within six miles of Et-chow-ee, eight miles south of
the present Franklin, North Carolina, a mile and a half below
Smith's Bridge, and was vigorously attacked from dense cover by
some six hundred and thirty warriors led by Si-lou-ee. Fighting
with Indian tactics, the Provincial Rangers under Patrick Calhoun
particularly 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
distinguished themselves; and the blood-curdling
yells of the painted savages were responded to by the wild huzzas
of the kilted Highlanders who, waving their Scotch bonnets,
impetuously charged the redskins and drove them again and again
from their lurking-places. Nevertheless Montgomerie lost from
eighty to one hundred in killed and wounded, while the loss of
the Indians was supposed to be about half the loss of the whites.
Unable to care for his wounded and lacking the means of removing
his baggage, Montgomerie silently withdrew his forces. In so
doing, he acknowledged defeat, since he was compelled to abandon
his original intention of relieving the beleaguered garrison of
Fort Loudon.
</p>

<p>
Captain Demere and his devoted little band, who had been
resolutely holding out, were now left to their tragic fate. After
the bread was exhausted, the garrison was reduced to the
necessity of eating dogs and horses; and the loyal aid of the
Indian wives of some of the garrison, who secretly brought them
supplies 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of food daily, enabled them to hold out still longer.
Realizing at last the futility of prolonging the hopeless
contest, Captain Demere surrendered the fort on August 8, 1760.
At daylight the next morning, while on the march to Fort Prince
George, the soldiers were set upon by the treacherous Cherokees,
who at the first onset killed Captain Demere and twenty-nine
others. A humane chieftain, Outassitus, says one of the gazettes
of the day, "went around the field calling upon the Indians to
desist, and making such representations to them as stopped the
further progress and effects of their barbarous and brutal rage,"
which expressed itself in scalping and hacking off the arms and
legs of the defenseless whites. Atta-kulla-kulla, who was
friendly to the whites, claimed Captain Stuart, the second
officer, as his captive, and bore him away by stealth. After nine
days' journey through the wilderness they encountered an advance
party under Major Andrew Lewis, sent out by Colonel Byrd, head of
a relieving army, to rescue and succor any of the garrison who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
might effect their escape. Thus Stuart was restored to his
friends. This abortive and tragic campaign, in which the victory
lay conclusively with the Indians, ended when Byrd disbanded his
new levies and Montgomerie sailed from Charleston for the north
(August, 1760).
</p>

<p>
During the remainder of the year, the province of North Carolina
remained free of further alarms from the Indians. But the view
was generally entertained that one more joint effort of North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia would have to be made in
order to humble the Cherokees. At the sessions of the North
Carolina Assembly in November and again in December, matters in
dispute between Governor Dobbs and the representatives of the
people made impossible the passage of a proposed aid bill,
providing for five hundred men to co&ouml;perate with Virginia and
South Carolina. Nevertheless volunteers in large numbers
patriotically marched from North Carolina to Charleston and the
Congaree (December, 1760, to April, 1761), to enlist in the
famous 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
regiment being organized by Colonel Thomas Middleton. 
<a href="#Note_70"><span class="superscript">[70]</span></a>
On March 31, 1761, Governor Dobbs called together the Assembly to
act upon a letter received from General Amherst, outlining a more
vigorous plan of campaign appropriate to the succession of a
young and vigorous sovereign, George III. An aid bill was passed,
providing twenty thousand pounds for men and supplies; and one
regiment of five companies of one hundred men each, under the
command of Colonel Hugh Waddell, was mustered into service for
seven months' duty, beginning May 1, 1761.
<a href="#Note_71"><span class="superscript">[71]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
On July 7, 1761, Colonel James Grant, detached from the main army
in command of a force of twenty-six hundred men, took up his
march from Fort Prince George. Attacked on June 10th two miles
south of the spot where Montgomerie was engaged the preceding
year, Grant's army, after a vigorous engagement lasting several
hours, drove off the Indians. The army then proceeded at leisure
to lay waste the fifteen towns of the Middle Settlements; and,
after this work of systematic devastation 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
was over, returned to
Fort Prince George. Peace was concluded in September as the
result of this campaign; and in consequence the frontier was
pushed seventy miles farther to the west.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, Colonel Waddell with his force of five hundred North
Carolinians had acted in concert with Colonel William Byrd,
commanding the Virginia detachment. The combined forces went into
camp at Captain Samuel Stalnaker's old place on the Middle Fork
of Holston. Because of his deliberately dilatory policy, Byrd was
superseded in the command by Colonel Adam Stephen. Marching their
forces to the Long Island of Holston, Stephen and Waddell erected
there Fort Robinson, in compliance with the instructions of
Governor Fauquier, of Virginia. The Cherokees, heartily tired of
the war, now sued for peace, which was concluded, independent of
the treaty at Charleston, on November 19, 1761.
</p>

<p>
The successful termination of this campaign had an effect of
signal importance in the development 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
of the expansionist spirit.
The rich and beautiful lands which fell under the eye of the
North Carolina and Virginia pioneers under Waddell, Byrd, and
Stephen, lured them irresistibly on to wider casts for fortune
and bolder explorations into the unknown, beckoning West.

It was thought good policy to settle those lands as fast as

for several decades the Virginia 
traders had been passing over the Great Trading Path to the towns of 
the Cherokees and the Catawbas, it was not until the early years of the
eighteenth century that Virginians of imaginative vision directed
their eyes to the westward, intent upon crossing the mountains
and locating settlements as a firm barrier against the
imperialistic designs of France. Acting upon his oft-expressed
conviction that once the English settlers had established
themselves at the source of the James 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
River "it would not be in
the power of the French to dislodge them," Governor Alexander
Spotswood in 1716, animated with the spirit of the pioneer, led
an expedition of fifty men and a train of pack-horses to the
mountains, arduously ascended to the summit of the Blue Ridge,
and claimed the country by right of discovery in behalf of his
sovereign. In the journal of John Fontaine this vivacious account
is given of the historic episode: "I graved my name on a tree by
the river side; and the Governor buried a bottle with a paper
enclosed on which he writ that he took possession of this place
in the name and for King George the First of England. We had a
good dinner, and after it we got the men together and loaded all
their arms and we drank the King's health in Burgundy and fired a
volley, and all the rest of the Royal Family in claret and a
volley. We drank the Governor's health and fired another volley."
</p>

<p>
By this jovial picnic, which the governor afterward commemorated
by presenting to each of the gentlemen who accompanied him 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
a golden horseshoe, inscribed with the legend, <i>Sic juvat
transcendere montes</i>, Alexander Spotswood anticipated by a third
of a century the more ambitious expedition on behalf of France by
C&egrave;loron de Bienville (see Chapter III), and gave a memorable
object-lesson in the true spirit of westward expansion. During
the ensuing years it began to dawn upon the minds of men of the
stamp of William Byrd and Joshua Gee that there was imperative
need for the establishment of a chain of settlements in the
trans-Alleghany, a great human wall to withstand the advancing
wave of French influence and occupation. By the fifth decade of
the century, as we have seen, the Virginia settlers, with their
squatter's claims and tomahawk rights, had pushed on to the
mountains; and great pressure was brought to bear upon the
council to issue grants for vast tracts of land in the uncharted
wilderness of the interior.
</p>

<p>
At this period the English ministry adopted the aggressive policy
already mentioned in connection with the French and Indian war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
indicative of a determination to contest with France the right to
occupy the interior of the continent. This policy had been
inaugurated by Virginia with the express purpose of stimulating
the adoption of a similar policy by North Carolina and
Pennsylvania. Two land companies, organized almost
simultaneously, actively promoted the preliminaries necessary to
settlement, despatching parties under expert leadership to
discover the passes through the mountains and to locate the best
land in the trans-Alleghany.
</p>

<p>
In June, 1749, a great corporation, the Loyal Land Company of
Virginia, received a grant of eight hundred thousand acres above
the North Carolina line and west of the mountains. Dr. Thomas
Walker, an expert surveyor, who in company with several other
gentlemen had made a tour of exploration through eastern
Tennessee and the Holston region in 1748, was chosen as the agent
of this company. Starting from his home in Albemarle County,
Virginia, March 6, 1750, accompanied by five stalwart pioneers,
Walker made a tour of exploration 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
to the westward, being absent
four months and one week. On this journey, which carried the
party as far west as the Rockcastle River (May 11th) and as far
north as the present Paintsville, Kentucky, they named many
natural objects, such as mountains and rivers, after members of
the party. Their two principal achievements were the erection of
the first house built by white men between the Cumberland
Mountains and the Ohio River&mdash;a feat, however, which led to no
important developments; and the discovery of the wonderful gap in
the Alleghanies to which Walker gave the name Cumberland, in
honor of the ruthless conqueror at Culloden, the "bloody duke."

In 1748 the Ohio Company was organized by Colonel Thomas Lee,
president of the Virginia council, and twelve other gentlemen, of
Virginia and Maryland. In their petition for five hundred
thousand acres, one of the declared objects of the company was
"to anticipate the French by taking possession of that country
southward of the Lakes to which the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
French had no right.&hellip;"
By the royal order of May 19, 1749, the company was awarded two
hundred thousand acres, free of quit-rent for ten years; and the
promise was made of an additional award of the remainder
petitioned for, on condition of seating a hundred families upon
the original grant and the building and maintaining of a fort.
Christopher Gist, summoned from his remote home on the Yadkin in
North Carolina, was instructed "to search out and discover the
Lands upon the river Ohio &amp; other adjoining branches of the
Mississippi down as low as the great Falls thereof." In this
journey, which began at Colonel Thomas Cresap's, in Maryland, in
October, 1750, and ended at Gist's home on May 18, 1751, Gist
visited the Lower Shawnee Town and the Lower Blue Licks, ascended
Pilot Knob almost two decades before Findlay and Boone, from the
same eminence, "saw with pleasure the beautiful level of
Kentucky," intersected Walker's route at two points, and crossed
Cumberland Mountain at Pound Gap on the return journey. This was
a far more 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
extended journey than Walker's, enabling Gist to
explore the fertile valleys of the Muskingum, Scioto, and Miami
rivers and to gain a view of the beautiful meadows of Kentucky.

</p>

<p>
It is eminently significant of the spirit of the age, which was
inaugurating an era of land-hunger unparalleled in American
history, that the first authentic records of the trans-Alleghany
were made by surveyors who visited the country as the agents of
great land companies. The outbreak of the French and Indian War
so soon afterward delayed for a decade and more any important
colonization of the West. Indeed, the explorations and findings
of Walker and Gist were almost unknown, even to the companies
they represented. But the conclusion of peace in 1763, which gave
all the region between the mountains and the Mississippi to the
British, heralded the true beginning of the westward expansionist
movement in the Old Southwest, and inaugurated the constructive
leadership of North Carolina in the occupation and colonization
of the imperial domain of Kentucky and the Ohio Valley.

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
In the middle years of the century many families of Virginia
gentry removed to the back country of North Carolina in the
fertile region ranging from Williamsborough on the east to
Hillsborough on the west. 
<a href="#Note_73"><span class="superscript">[73]</span></a>
There soon arose in this section of the
colony a society marked by intellectual distinction, social
graces, and the leisured dignity of the landlord and the large
planter. So conspicuous for means, intellect, culture, and
refinement were the people of this group, having "abundance of
wealth and leisure for enjoyment," that Governor Josiah Martin,
in passing through this region some years later, significantly
observes: "They have great pre-eminence, as well with respect to
soil and cultivation, as to the manners and condition of the
inhabitants, in which last respect the difference is so great
that one would be led to think them people of another region."
<a href="#Note_74"><span class="superscript">[74]</span></a>
This new wealthy class which was now turning its gaze toward the
unoccupied lands along the frontier was "dominated by the
democratic ideals of pioneers rather than by the aristocratic
tendencies 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
of slave-holding planters." 
<a href="#Note_75"><span class="superscript">[75]</span></a>
From the cross-fertilization
of the ideas of two social groups&mdash;this back-country
gentry, of innate qualities of leadership, democratic
instincts, economic independence, and expansive tendencies, and
the primitive pioneer society of the frontier, frugal in taste,
responsive to leadership, bold, ready, and thorough in
execution&mdash;there evolved the militant American expansion in the Old
Southwest.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_104_2" id="Page_104_2"></a>
A conspicuous figure in this society of Virginia emigrants was a
young man named Richard Henderson, whose father had removed with
his family from Hanover County, Virginia, to Bute, afterward
Granville County, North Carolina, in 1742. 
<a href="#Note_76"><span class="superscript">[76]</span></a>
Educated at home by a
private tutor, he began his career as assistant of his father,
Samuel Henderson, the High Sheriff of Granville County; and after
receiving a law-license, quickly acquired an extensive practice.
"Even in the superior courts where oratory and eloquence are as
brilliant and powerful as in Westminster-hall," records an
English acquaintance, "he 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
soon became distinguished and eminent,
and his superior genius shone forth with great splendour, and
universal applause." This young attorney, wedded to the daughter
of an Irish lord, often visited Salisbury on his legal circuit;
and here he became well acquainted with Squire Boone, one of the
"Worshipfull Justices," and often appeared in suits before him.
By his son, the nomadic Daniel Boone, conspicuous already for his
solitary wanderings across the dark green mountains to the
sun-lit valleys and boundless hunting-grounds beyond, Henderson
was from time to time regaled with bizarre and fascinating tales
of western exploration; and Boone, in his dark hour of poverty
and distress, when he was heavily involved financially, turned
for aid to this friend and his partner, who composed the law-firm
of Williams and Henderson.
<a href="#Note_77"><span class="superscript">[77]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Boone's vivid descriptions of the paradise of the West stimulated
Henderson's imaginative mind and attracted his attention to the
rich possibilities of unoccupied lands there. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
While the Board of
Trade in drafting the royal proclamation of October 7, 1763,
forbade the granting of lands in the vast interior, which was
specifically reserved to the Indians, it was clearly not their
intention to set permanent western limits to the colonies. 
<a href="#Note_78"><span class="superscript">[78]</span></a>
The prevailing opinion among the shrewdest men of the period was well
expressed by George Washington, who wrote his agent for
pre&euml;mpting western lands: "I can never look upon that
proclamation in any other light (but I say this between
ourselves) than as a temporary expedient to quiet the minds of
the Indians." And again in 1767: "It [the proclamation of 1763]
must fall, of course, in a few years, especially when those
Indians consent to our occupying the lands. Any person,
therefore, who neglects the present opportunity of hunting out
good lands, and in some measure marking out and distinguishing
them for his own, in order to keep others from settling them,
will never regain it." Washington had added greatly to his
holdings of bounty lands in the West by purchasing at trivial
prices the claims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of many of the officers and soldiers. Three
years later we find him surveying extensive tracts along the Ohio
and the Great Kanawha, and, with the vision of the expansionist,
making large plans for the establishment of a colony to be seated
upon his own lands. Henderson, too, recognized the importance of
the great country west of the Appalachians. He agreed with the
opinion of Benjamin Franklin, who in 1756 called it "one of the
finest in North America for the extreme richness and fertility of
the land, the healthy temperature of the air and the mildness of
the climate, the plenty of hunting, fishing and fowling, the
facility of trade with the Indians and the vast convenience of
inland navigation or water carriage." 
<a href="#Note_79"><span class="superscript">[79]</span></a>
Henderson therefore
proceeded to organize a land company for the purpose of acquiring
and colonizing a large domain in the West. This partnership,
which was entitled Richard Henderson and Company, was composed of
a few associates, including Richard Henderson, his uncle and
law-partner, John Williams, and, in all probability, their close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
friends Thomas and Nathaniel Hart of Orange County, North
Carolina, immigrants from Hanover County, Virginia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_108_2" id="Page_108_2"></a>
Seizing the opportunity presented just after the conclusion of
peace, the company engaged Daniel Boone as scout and surveyor. He
was instructed, while hunting and trapping on his own account, to
examine, with respect to their location and fertility, the lands
which he visited, and to report his findings upon his return. The
secret expedition must have been transacted with commendable
circumspection; for although in after years it became common
knowledge among his friends that he had acted as the company's
agent, Boone himself consistently refrained from betraying the
confidence of his employers. 
<a href="#Note_80"><span class="superscript">[80]</span></a>
Upon a similar mission, Gist had
carefully concealed from the suspicious Indians the fact that he
carried a compass, which they wittily termed "land stealer"; and
Washington likewise imposed secrecy upon his land agent Crawford,
insisting that the operation be carried on under the guise of
hunting game.
<a href="#Note_81"><span class="superscript">[81]</span></a>
The discreet Boone, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
taciturn and given to keeping
his own counsel, in one instance at least deemed it advantageous
to communicate the purpose of his mission to some hunters, well
known to him, in order to secure the results of their information
in regard to the best lands they had encountered in the course of
their hunting expedition. Boone came among the hunters, known as
the "Blevens connection," at one of their Tennessee station camps
on their return from a long hunt in Kentucky, in order, as
expressed in the quaint phraseology of the period, to be
"informed of the geography and locography of these woods, saying
that he was employed to explore them by Henderson &amp; Company."
<a href="#Note_82"><span class="superscript">[82]</span></a> 
The acquaintance which Boone on this occasion formed with a member of
the party, Henry Scaggs, the skilled hunter and explorer, was
soon to bear fruit; for shortly afterward Scaggs was employed as
prospector by the same land company. In 1764 Scaggs had passed
through Cumberland Gap and hunted for the season on the
Cumberland; and accordingly the following year, as the agent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Richard Henderson and Company, he was despatched on an extended
exploration to the lower Cumberland, fixing his station at the
salt lick afterward known as Mansker's Lick.
<a href="#Note_83"><span class="superscript">[83]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_110_2" id="Page_110_2"></a>
Richard Henderson thus, it appears, "enlisted the Harts and
others in an enterprise which his own genius planned," says Peck,
the personal acquaintance and biographer of Boone, "and then
encouraged several hunters to explore the country and learn where
the best lands lay." Just why Henderson and his associates did
not act sooner upon the reports brought back by the 
hunters&mdash;Boone and Scaggs and Callaway, who accompanied 
Boone in 1764 in the interest of the land company&mdash;is not 
known;
<a href="#Note_84"><span class="superscript">[84]</span></a>
 but in all probability the fragmentary nature of these 
reports, however glowing and enthusiastic, was sufficient cause 
for the delay of five years before the land company, through the 
agency of Boone and Findlay, succeeded in having a thorough 
exploration made of the Kentucky region. Delay was also caused 
by rival claims to the territory. In the <i>Virginia Gazette</i> 
of December 1, 1768, Henderson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
must have read with astonishment not unmixed with dismay that
"the Six Nations and all their tributaries have granted a vast
extent of country to his majesty, and the Proprietaries of
Pennsylvania, and settled an advantageous boundary line between
their hunting country and this, and the other colonies to the
Southward as far as the Cherokee River, for which they received
the most valuable present in goods and dollars that was ever
given at any conference since the settlement of America." The
news was now bruited about through the colony of North Carolina
that the Cherokees were hot in their resentment because the
Northern Indians, the inveterate foes of the Cherokees and the
perpetual disputants for the vast Middle Ground of Kentucky, had
received at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, November 5, 1768, an
immense compensation from the crown for the territory which they,
the Cherokees, claimed from time immemorial. 
<a href="#Note_85"><span class="superscript">[85]</span></a>
Only three weeks
before, John Stuart, Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the
Southern Department, had negotiated with 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the Cherokees the Treaty
of Hard Labor, South Carolina (October 14th), by which Governor
Tryon's line of 1767, from Reedy River to Tryon Mountain, was
continued direct to Colonel Chiswell's mine, the present
Wytheville, Virginia, and thence in a straight line to the mouth
of the Great Kanawha. 
<a href="#Note_86"><span class="superscript">[86]</span></a>
Thus at the close of the year 1768 the
crown through both royal governor and superintendent of Indian
affairs acknowledged in fair and open treaty the right of the
Cherokees, whose Tennessee villages guarded the gateway, to the
valley lands east of the mountain barrier as well as to the dim
mid-region of Kentucky. In the very act of negotiating the Treaty
of Fort Stanwix, Sir William Johnson privately acknowledged that
possession of the trans-Alleghany could be legally obtained only
by extinguishing the title of the Cherokees.
<a href="#Note_87"><span class="superscript">[87]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
These conflicting claims soon led to collisions between the
Indians and the company's settlers. In the spring of 1769
occurred one of those incidents in the westward advance which,
though slight in itself, was to have a 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
definite bearing upon the
course of events in later years. In pursuance of his policy, as
agent of the Loyal Land Company, of promoting settlement upon the
company's lands, Dr. Thomas Walker, who had visited Powell's
Valley the preceding year and come into possession of a very
large tract there, simultaneously made proposals to one party of
men including the Kirtleys, Captain Rucker, and others, and to
another party led by Joseph Martin, trader of Orange County,
Virginia, afterward a striking figure in the Old Southwest. The
fevered race by these bands of eighteenth-century "sooners" for
possession of an early "Cherokee Strip" was won by the latter
band, who at once took possession and began to clear; so that
when the Kirtleys arrived, Martin coolly handed them "a letter
from Dr. Walker that informed them that if we got to the valley
first, we were to have 21,000 acres of land, and they were not to
interfere with us." Martin and his companions were delighted with
the beautiful valley at the base of the Cumberland, quickly "eat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and destroyed 23 deer&mdash;15 bears&mdash;2 buffaloes and a great quantity
of turkeys," and entertained gentlemen from Virginia and Maryland
who desired to settle more than a hundred families there. The
company reckoned, however, without their hosts, the Cherokees,
who, fortified by the treaty of Hard Labor (1768) which left this
country within the Indian reservation, were determined to drive
Martin and his company out. While hunting on the Cumberland
River, northwest of Cumberland Gap, Martin and his company were
surrounded and disarmed by a party of Cherokees who said they had
orders from Cameron, the royal agent, to rob all white men
hunting on their lands. When Martin and his party arrived at
their station in Powell's Valley, they found it broken up and
their goods stolen by the Indians, which left them no recourse
but to return to the settlements in Virginia. It was not until
six years later that Martin, under the stable influence of the
Transylvania Company, was enabled to return to this spot and
erect there 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the station which was to play an integral part in the
progress of westward expansion.
<a href="#Note_88"><span class="superscript">[88]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Before going on to relate Boone's explorations of Kentucky under
the auspices of the land company, it will be convenient to turn
back for a moment and give some account of other hunters and
explorers who visited that territory between the time of its
discovery by Walker and Gist and the advent of Boone.

     The Long Hunters in the Twilight Zone

<p class="intro">
The long Hunters principally resided in the upper countries of
Virginia &amp; North Carolina on New River &amp; Holston River, and when

<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smcap">efore</span> 
the coming of Walker and Gist in 
1750 and 1751 respectively, the region now called Kentucky had, as 
far as we know, been twice visited by the French, once in 1729 when 
Chaussegros de L&eacute;ry and his party visited the Big Bone Lick, and
again in the summer of 1749 when the Baron de Longueuil with four
hundred and fifty-two Frenchmen and Indians, going to join
Bienville in an expedition against "the Cherickees and other
Indians lying at the back of Carolina and Georgia," doubtless
encamped on the Kentucky shore of the Ohio. Kentucky was also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
traversed by John Peter Salling with his three adventurous
companions in their journey through the Middle West in 1742. But
all these early visits, including the memorable expeditions of
Walker and Gist, were so little known to the general public that
when John Filson wrote the history of Kentucky in 1784 he
attributed its discovery to James McBride in 1754. More
influential upon the course of westward expansion was an
adventure which occurred in 1752, the very year in which the
Boones settled down in their Yadkin home.
</p>

<p>
In the autumn of 1752, a Pennsylvania trader, John Findlay, with
three or four companions, descended the Ohio River in a canoe as
far as the falls at the present Louisville, Kentucky, and
accompanied a party of Shawanoes to their town of
Es-kip-pa-ki-thi-ki, eleven miles east of what is now Winchester.
This was the site of the "Indian Old Corn Field," the Iroquois
name for which ("the place of many fields," or "prairie") was
Ken-ta-ke, whence came the name of the state.
Five miles east of this spot, where still may 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
be seen a mound and an ellipse showing the outline of the stockade, 
is the famous Pilot Knob, from the summit of which the fields 
surrounding the town lie visible in their smooth expanse. During 
Findlay's stay at the Indian town other traders from Pennsylvania 
and Virginia, who reported that they were "on their return from 
trading with the Cuttawas (Catawbas), a nation who live in the 
Territories of Carolina," assembled in the vicinity in January, 
1753. Here, as the result of disputes arising from their barter, 
they were set upon and captured by a large party of straggling 
Indians (Coghnawagas from Montreal) on January 26th; but Findlay and
another trader named James Lowry were so fortunate as to escape
and return through the wilderness to the Pennsylvania
settlements. 
<a href="#Note_89"><span class="superscript">[89]</span></a>
The incident is of important historic significance;
for it was from these traders, who must have followed the Great
Warriors' Path to the country of the Catawbas, that Findlay
learned of the Ouasioto (Cumberland) Gap traversed by the Indian
path. His reminiscences&mdash;of this 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
gateway to Kentucky, of the site
of the old Indian town on Lulbegrud Creek, a tributary of the Red
River, and of the Pilot Knob&mdash;were sixteen years later to fire
Boone to his great tour of exploration in behalf of the
Transylvania Company.
</p>

<p>
During the next two decades, largely because of the hostility of
the savage tribes, only a few traders and hunters from the east
ranged through the trans-Alleghany. But in 1761, a party of
hunters led by a rough frontiersman, Elisha Walden, penetrated
into Powell's Valley, followed the Indian trail through
Cumberland Gap, explored the Cumberland River, and finally
reached the Laurel Mountain where, encountering a party of
Indians, they deemed it expedient to return. With Walden went
Henry Scaggs, afterward explorer for the Henderson Land Company,
William Blevens and Charles Cox, the famous Virginia hunters, one
Newman, and some fifteen other stout pioneers. Their itinerary
may be traced from the names given to natural objects in honor of
members of the party&mdash;Walden's 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Mountain and Walden's Creek,
Scaggs' Ridge and Newman's Ridge. Following the peace of 1763,
which made travel in this region moderately safe once more, the
English proceeded to occupy the territory which they had won. In
1765 George Croghan with a small party, on the way to prepare the
inhabitants of the Illinois country for transfer to English
sovereignty, visited the Great Bone Licks of Kentucky (May 30th,
31st); and a year later Captain Harry Gordon, chief engineer in
the Western Department in North America, visited and minutely
described the same licks and the falls. But these, and numerous
other water-journeys and expeditions of which no records were
kept, though interesting enough in themselves, had little bearing
upon the larger phases of westward expansion and colonization.
</p>

<p>
The decade opening with the year 1765 is the epoch of bold and
ever bolder exploration&mdash;the more adventurous frontiersmen of the
border pushing deep into the wilderness in search of game, lured
on by the excitements 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
of the chase and the profit to be derived from the sale of peltries. 
In midsummer, 1766, Captain James Smith, Joshua Horton, Uriah Stone, 
William Baker, and a young mulatto slave passed through Cumberland 
Gap, hunted through the country south of the Cherokee and along the 
Cumberland and Tennessee rivers, and as Smith reports "found no 
vestige of any white man." During the same year a party of five 
hunters from South Carolina, led by Isaac Lindsey, penetrated the 
Kentucky wilderness to the tributary of the Cumberland, named Stone's
River by the former party, for one of their number. Here they
encountered two men, who were among the greatest of the western
pioneers, and were destined to leave their names in historic
association with the early settlement of Kentucky&mdash;James Harrod
and Michael Stoner, a German, both of whom had descended the Ohio
from Fort Pitt. With the year 1769 began those longer and more
extended excursions into the interior which were to result in
conveying at last to the outside 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
world graphic and detailed
information concerning "the wonderful new country of Cantucky."
In the late spring of this year Hancock and Richard Taylor (the
latter the father of President Zachary Taylor), Abraham
Hempinstall, and one Barbour, all true-blue frontiersmen, left
their homes in Orange County, Virginia, and hunted extensively in
Kentucky and Arkansas. Two of the party traveled through Georgia
and East and West Florida; while the other two hunted on the
Washita during the winter of 1770-1. Explorations of this type
became increasingly hazardous as the animosity of the Indians
increased; and from this time onward for a number of years almost
all the parties of roving hunters suffered capture or attack by
the crafty red men. In this same year Major John McCulloch,
living on the south branch of the Potomac, set out accompanied by
a white man-servant and a negro, to explore the western country.
While passing down the Ohio from Pittsburgh McCulloch was
captured by the Indians near the mouth of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Wabash and carried
to the present site of Terre Haute, Indiana. Set free after four
or five months, he journeyed in company with some French
<i>voyageurs</i> first to Natchez and then to New Orleans, whence he
made the sea voyage to Philadelphia. Somewhat later, Benjamin
Cleveland (afterward famous in the Revolution), attended by four
companions, set out from his home on the upper Yadkin to explore
the Kentucky wilderness. After passing through Cumberland Gap,
they encountered a band of Cherokees who plundered them of
everything they had, even to their hats and shoes, and ordered
them to leave the Indian hunting-grounds. On their return journey
they almost starved, and Cleveland, who was reluctantly forced to
kill his faithful little hunting-dog, was wont to declare in
after years that it was the sweetest meat he ever ate.
</p>

<p>
Fired to adventure by the glowing accounts brought back by Uriah
Stone, a much more formidable band than any that had hitherto
ventured westward&mdash;including Uriah Stone as pilot, Gasper
Mansker, John Rains, the Bledsoes, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
and a dozen others&mdash;assembled
in June, 1769, in the New River region. "Each Man carried two
horses," says an early pioneer in describing one of these
parties, "traps, a large supply of powder and led, and a small
hand vise and bellows, files and screw plate for the purpose of
fixing the guns if any of them should get out of fix." Passing
through Cumberland Gap, they continued their long journey until
they reached Price's Meadow, in the present Wayne County,
Kentucky, where they established their encampment. In the course
of their explorations, during which they gave various names to
prominent natural features, they established their "station camp"
on a creek in Sumner County, Tennessee, whence originated the
name of Station Camp Creek. Isaac Bledsoe and Gasper Mansker,
agreeing to travel from here in opposite directions along a
buffalo trace passing near the camp, each succeeded in
discovering the famous salt-lick which bears his name&mdash;namely
Bledsoe's Lick and Mansker's Lick. The flat surrounding the lick,
about one hundred acres in extent,

discovered by Bledsoe,
according to his own statement "was principally Covered with
buffelows in every direction&mdash;not hundreds but thousands." As he
sat on his horse, he shot down two deer in the lick; but the
buffaloes blindly trod them in the mud. They did not mind him and
his horse except when the wind blew the scent in their nostrils,
when they would break and run in droves. Indians often lurked in
the neighbourhood of these hunters&mdash;plundering their camp,
robbing them, and even shooting down one of their number, Robert
Crockett, from ambush. After many trials and vicissitudes, which
included a journey to the Spanish Natchez and the loss of a great
mass of peltries when they were plundered by Piomingo and a war
party of Chickasaws, they finally reached home in the late spring
of 1770.

</p>

<p>
The most notable expedition of this period, projected under the
auspices of two bold leaders extraordinarily skilled in
woodcraft, Joseph Drake and Henry Scaggs, was organized in the
early autumn of 1770. This imposing 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
band of stalwart hunters from
the New River and Holston country, some forty in number, garbed
in hunting shirts, leggings, and moccasins, with three
pack-horses to each man, rifles, ammunition, traps, dogs,
blankets, and salt, pushed boldly through Cumberland Gap into the
heart of what was later justly named the "Dark and Bloody Ground"
(see Chapter XIV)&mdash;"not doubting," says an old border chronicler,
"that they were to be encountered by Indians, and to subsist on
game." From the duration of their absence from home, they
received the name of the Long Hunters&mdash;the romantic appellation
by which they are known in the pioneer history of the Old
Southwest. Many natural objects were named by this party&mdash;in
particular Dick's River, after the noted Cherokee hunter, Captain
Dick, who, pleased to be recognized by Charles Scaggs, told the
Long Hunters that on <em>his</em> river, pointing it out, they would 
find meat plenty&mdash;adding with laconic significance: "Kill it 
and go home." From the Knob Lick, in Lincoln County, as reported 
by a member of the party, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
"they beheld largely over a thousand
animals, including buffaloe, elk, bear, and deer, with many wild
turkies scattered among them; all quite restless, some playing,
and others busily employed in licking the earth.&hellip; The
buffaloe and other animals had so eaten away the soil, that they
could, in places, go entirely underground." Upon the return of a
detachment to Virginia, fourteen fearless hunters chose to
remain; and one day, during the absence of some of the band upon
a long exploring trip, the camp was attacked by a straggling
party of Indians under Will Emery, a half-breed Cherokee. Two of
the hunters were carried into captivity and never heard of again;
a third managed to escape. In embittered commemoration of the
plunder of the camp and the destruction of the peltries, they
inscribed upon a poplar, which had lost its bark, this emphatic
record, followed by their names:
</p>

<p style="font-size:small;">
<a name="Page_127_2" id="Page_127_2"></a>
2300 Deer Skins lost &nbsp; &nbsp; Ruination by God
<a href="#Note_91"><span class="superscript">[91]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Undismayed by this depressing stroke of fortune, they continued
their hunt in the direction 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
of the lick which Bledsoe had discovered the preceding year. Shortly 
after this discovery, a French <i>voyageur</i> from the Illinois who 
had hunted and traded in this region for a decade, Timoth&eacute; de 
Monbreun, subsequently famous in the history of Tennessee, had visited 
the lick and killed an enormous number of buffaloes for their tallow 
and tongues with which he and his companion loaded a keel boat and
descended the Cumberland. An early pioneer, William Hall, learned
from Isaac Bledsoe that when "the long hunters Crossed the ridge
and came down on Bledsoe's Creek in four or five miles of the
Lick the Cane had grown up so thick in the woods that they
thought they had mistaken the place until they Came to the Lick
and saw what had been done.&hellip; One could walk for several
hundred yards a round the Lick and in the lick on buffellows
Skuls, &amp; bones and the whole flat round the Lick was bleached
with buffellows bones, and they found out the Cause of the Canes
growing up so suddenly a few miles around the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Lick which was in
Consequence of so many buffellows being killed."
</p>

<p>
This expedition was of genuine importance, opening the eyes of
the frontiersmen to the charms of the country and influencing
many to settle subsequently in the West&mdash;some in Tennessee, some
in Kentucky. The elaborate and detailed information brought back
by Henry Scaggs exerted an appreciable influence, no doubt, in
accelerating the plans of Richard Henderson and Company for the
acquisition and colonization of the trans-Alleghany. But while
the "Long Hunters" were in Tennessee and Kentucky the same region
was being more extensively and systematically explored by Daniel
Boone. To his life, character, and attainments, as the typical
"long hunter" and the most influential pioneer we may now turn
our particular attention.

     Daniel Boone and Wilderness Exploration

distressed, sounded in our ears, we now hear the praises and

<p class="intro-right">
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daniel Boone</span>, 1784.
</p>

<br>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> 
wandering life of a border Nimrod 
in a surpassingly beautiful country teeming with game was the 
ideal of the frontiersman of the eighteenth century. As early as 
1728, while running the dividing line between North Carolina and 
Virginia, William Byrd encountered along the North Carolina 
frontier the typical figure of the professional hunter: 
"a famous Woodsman, call'd
Epaphroditus Bainton. This Forester Spends all his time in
ranging the Woods, and is said to make great Havock among the
Deer, and other Inhabitants 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
of the Forest, not much wilder than
himself." By the middle of the century, as he was threading his
way through the Carolina piedmont zone, the hunter's paradise of
the Yadkin and Catawba country, Bishop Spangenberg found ranging
there many hunters, living like Indians, who killed thousands of
deer each year and sold the skins in the local markets or to the
fur-traders from Virginia whose heavy pack-trains with their
tinkling bells constantly traversed the course of the Great
Trading Path.</p>
<p>
The superlative skill of one of these hunters, both
as woodsman and marksman, was proverbial along the border. The
name of Daniel Boone became synonymous with expert huntsmanship
and almost uncanny wisdom in forest lore. The bottoms of the
creek near the Boone home, three miles west of present
Mocksville, contained a heavy growth of beech, which dropped
large quantities of its rich nuts or mast, greatly relished by
bears; and this creek received its name, Bear Creek, because
Daniel and his father killed in its rich bottoms 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
ninety-nine bears in a single hunting-season. After living for a time 
with his young wife, Rebecca Bryan, in a cabin in his father's yard,
Daniel built a home of his own upon a tract of land, purchased
from his father on October 12, 1759, and lying on Sugar Tree, a
tributary of Dutchman's Creek. Here he dwelt for the next five
years, with the exception of the period of his temporary removal
to Virginia during the terrible era of the Indian war. Most of
his time during the autumn and winter, when he was not engaged in
wagoning or farming, he spent in long hunting-journeys into the
mountains to the west and northwest. During the hunting-season of
1760 he struck deeper than ever before into the western mountain
region and encamped in a natural rocky shelter amidst fine
hunting-grounds, in what is now Washington County in east
Tennessee. Of the scores of inscriptions commemorative of his
hunting-feats, which Boone with pardonable pride was accustomed
throughout his life-time to engrave with his hunting-knife upon
trees and rocks, the earliest known is found 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
upon a leaning beech
tree, only recently fallen, near his camp and the creek which
since that day has borne his name. This is a characteristic and
enduring record in the history of American exploration:

<p class="noindent">
Late in the summer of the following year Boone marched under the
command of the noted Indian-fighter of the border, Colonel Hugh
Waddell, in his campaign against the Cherokees. From the lips of
Waddell, who was outspoken in his condemnation of Byrd's futile
delays in road-cutting and fort-building, Boone learned the true
secret of success in Indian warfare, which was lost upon
Braddock, Forbes, and later St. Clair: that the art of defeating
red men was to deal them a sudden and unexpected blow, before
they had time either to learn the strength of the force employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
against them or to lay with subtle craft their artful ambuscade.
</p>

<p>
In the late autumn of 1761, Daniel Boone and Nathaniel Gist, the
son of Washington's famous guide, who were both serving under
Waddell, temporarily detached themselves from his command and led
a small party on a "long hunt" in the Valley of the Holston.
While encamping near the site of Black's Fort, subsequently
built, they were violently assailed by a pack of fierce wolves
which they had considerable difficulty in beating off; and from
this incident the locality became known as Wolf Hills (now
Abingdon, Virginia).
<a href="#Note_92"><span class="superscript">[92]</span></a>
</p>


<p>
From this time forward Boone's roving instincts had full sway.
For many months each year he threaded his way through that
marvelously beautiful country of western North Carolina
felicitously described as the Switzerland of America. Boone's
love of solitude and the murmuring forest was surely inspired by
the phenomenal beauties of the country through which he roamed
at will. Blowing Rock on one arm of a 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
great horseshoe of
mountains and Tryon Mountain upon the other arm, overlooked an
enormous, primeval bowl, studded by a thousand emerald-clad
eminences. There was the Pilot Mountain, the towering and
isolated pile which from time immemorial had served the
aborigines as a guide in their forest wanderings; there was the
dizzy height of the Roan on the border; there was Mt. Mitchell,
portentous in its grandeur, the tallest peak on the continent
east of the Rockies; and there was the Grandfather, the oldest
mountain on earth according to geologists, of which it has been
written:
</p>

laurel, and the azalea rising like flame; or the rare beauties of
the water&mdash;the cataract of Linville, taking its shimmering leap
into the gorge, and that romantic river poetically celebrated in
the lines:

</div>


<p>
The long rambling excursions which Boone made through western
North Carolina and eastern Tennessee enabled him to explore every
nook and corner of the rugged and beautiful mountain region.
Among the companions 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
and contemporaries with whom he hunted and
explored the country were his little son James and his brother
Jesse; the Linville who gave the name to the beautiful falls;
Julius C&aelig;sar Dugger, whose rock house stood near the head of Elk
Creek; and Nathaniel Gist, who described for him the lofty
gateway to Kentucky, through which Christopher Gist had passed in
1751. Boone had already heard of this gateway, from Findlay, and
it was one of the secret and cherished ambitions of his life to
scale the mountain wall of the Appalachians and to reach that
high portal of the Cumberland which beckoned to the mysterious
new Eden beyond. Although hunting was an endless delight to Boone
he was haunted in the midst of this pleasure, as was Kipling's
Explorer, by the lure of the undiscovered:
</p>

<div class="poem1">
    <p class="poem-noindent1">Till a voice as bad as conscience, rang interminable changes</p>
    <p class="poem-noindent1">On one everlasting whisper day and night repeated&mdash;so:</p>
    <p class="poem-noindent1">'Something hidden. Go and find it. Go and look behind the ranges&mdash;
		   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
	  </p>
		<p class="poem-noindent1">'Something lost behind the ranges. Lost and waiting for you. Go.'</p>
</div>


<p>
Of Boone's preliminary explorations for the land company known as
Richard Henderson and Company, an account has already been given;
and the delay in following them up has been touched on and in
part explained. Meanwhile Boone transferred his efforts for a
time to another field. Toward the close of the summer of 1765 a
party consisting of Major John Field, William Hill, one
Slaughter, and two others, all from Culpeper County, Virginia,
visited Boone and induced him to accompany them on the "long
Journey" to Florida, whither they were attracted by the liberal
offer of Colonel James Grant, governor of the eastern section,
the Florida of to-day. On this long and arduous expedition they
suffered many hardships and endured many privations, found little
game, and on one occasion narrowly escaped starvation. They
explored Florida from St. Augustine to Pensacola; and Boone, who
relished fresh scenes and a new environment, purchased a house
and lot 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
in Pensacola in anticipation of removal thither. But upon
his return home, finding his wife unwilling to go, Boone once
more turned his eager eye toward the West, that mysterious and
alluring region beyond the great range, the fabled paradise of
Kentucky.
</p>

<p>
The following year four young men from the Yadkin, Benjamin
Cutbird, John Stewart (Boone's brother-in-law who afterwards
accompanied him to Kentucky), John Baker, and James Ward made a
remarkable journey to the westward, crossing the Appalachian
mountain chain over some unknown route, and finally reaching the
Mississippi. The significance of the journey, in its bearing upon
westward expansion, inheres in the fact that while for more than
half a century the English traders from South Carolina had been
winning their way to the Mississippi along the lower routes and
Indian trails, this was the first party from either of the
Carolinas, as far as is known, that ever reached the Mississippi
by crossing the great mountain barrier. When Cutbird, a superb
woodsman and veritable Leatherstocking, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
narrated to Boone the story of his adventures, it only confirmed Boone 
in his determination to find the passage through the mountain chain
leading to the Mesopotamia of Kentucky.
</p>

<p>
Such an enterprise was attended by terrible dangers. During 1766
and 1767 the steady encroachments of the white settlers upon the
ancestral domain which the Indians reserved for their imperial
hunting-preserve aroused bitter feelings of resentment among the
red men. Bloody reprisal was often the sequel to such
encroachment. The vast region of Tennessee and the
trans-Alleghany was a twilight zone, through which the savages
roamed at will. From time to time war parties of northern
Indians, the inveterate foes of the Cherokees, scouted through
this no-man's land and even penetrated into the western region of
North Carolina, committing murders and depredations upon the
Cherokees and the whites indiscriminately. During the summer of
1766, while Boone's friend and close connection, Captain William
Linville, his son John, and 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
another young man, named John
Williams, were in camp some ten miles below Linville Falls, they
were unexpectedly fired upon by a hostile band of Northern
Indians, and before they had time to fire a shot, a second volley
killed both the Linvilles and severely wounded Williams, who
after extraordinary sufferings finally reached the settlements.
<a href="#Note_93"><span class="superscript">[93]</span></a>
In May, 1767, four traders and a half-breed child of one of them
were killed in the Cherokee country. In the summer of this year
Governor William Tryon of North Carolina laid out the boundary
line of the Cherokees, and upon his return issued a proclamation
forbidding any purchase of land from the Indians and any issuance
of grants for land within one mile of the boundary line. Despite
this wise precaution, seven North Carolina hunters who during the
following September had lawlessly ventured into the mountain
region some sixty miles beyond the boundary were fired upon, and
several of them killed, by the resentful Cherokees. 
<a href="#Note_94"><span class="superscript">[94]</span></a>
<p>
Undismayed by these signs of impending 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
danger, undeterred even by the tragic fate of the Linvilles, 
Daniel Boone, with the determination of the indomitable pioneer, 
never dreamed of relinquishing his long-cherished design. 
Discouraged by the steady disappearance of game under the 
ruthless attack of innumerable hunters, Boone continued to 
direct his thoughts toward the project of exploring the fair 
region of Kentucky. The adventurous William Hill, to whom Boone 
communicated his purpose, readily consented to go with him; and 
in the autumn of 1767 Boone and Hill, accompanied, it is believed, 
by Squire Boone, Daniel's brother, set forth upon their almost 
inconceivably hazardous expedition. They crossed the Blue Ridge 
and the Alleghanies, the Holston and Clinch rivers near their 
sources, and finally reached the head waters of the West Fork of 
the Big Sandy. Surmising from its course that this stream must 
flow into the Ohio, they pushed on a hundred miles to the
westward and finally, by following a buffalo path, reached a
salt-spring in what is now Floyd County, in the extreme 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
eastern section of Kentucky. Here Boone beheld great droves of buffalo
that visited the salt-spring to drink the water or lick the
brackish soil. After spending the winter in hunting and trapping,
the Boones and Hill, discouraged by the forbidding aspect of the
hilly country which with its dense growth of laurel was
exceedingly difficult to penetrate, abandoned all hope of finding
Kentucky by this route and wended their arduous way back to the
Yadkin.
</p>

<p>
The account of Boone's subsequent accomplishment of his purpose
must be postponed to the next chapter.

<span class="dropcap">A</span>
<span class="smcap">chance</span> 
acquaintance formed by Daniel Boone, 
during the French and Indian War, with the Irish lover of adventure, 
John Findlay, 
<a href="#Note_95"><span class="superscript">[95]</span></a>
was the origin of Boone's cherished longing to reach the El
Dorado of the West. In this slight incident we may discern the
initial inspiration for the epochal movement of westward
expansion. Findlay was a trader and horse peddler, who had early
migrated to Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He had been licensed a trader
with the Indians in 1747. During the same year he was married to
Elizabeth Harris, daughter of John Harris, the Indian-trader 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
at Harris's Ferry on the Susquehanna River, after whom Harrisburg
was named. During the next eight years Findlay carried on his
business of trading in the interior. Upon the opening of the
French and Indian War he was probably among "the young men about
Paxtang who enlisted immediately," and served as a waggoner in
Braddock's expedition. Over the camp-fires, during the ensuing
campaign in 1765, young Boone was an eager listener to Findlay's
stirring narrative of his adventures in the Ohio Valley and on
the wonderfully beautiful levels of Kentucky in 1752. The fancies
aroused in his brooding mind by Findlay's moving recital and his
description of an ancient passage through the Ouasioto or
Cumberland Gap and along the course of the Warrior's Path,
inspired him with an irrepressible longing to reach that alluring
promised land which was the perfect realization of the hunter's
paradise.
</p>

<p>
Thirteen years later, while engaged in selling pins, needles,
thread, and Irish linens in 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the Yadkin country, Findlay learned
from the Pennsylvania settlers at Salisbury or at the Forks of
the Yadkin of Boone's removal to the waters of the upper Yadkin.
At Boone's rustic home, in the winter of 1768-9, Findlay visited
his old comrade-in-arms of Braddock's campaign. On learning of
Boone's failure during the preceding year to reach the Kentucky
levels by way of the inhospitable Sandy region, Findlay again
described to him the route through the Ouasioto Gap traversed
sixteen years before by Pennsylvania traders in their traffic
with the Catawbas. Boone, as we have seen, knew that Christopher
Gist, who had formerly lived near him on the upper Yadkin, had
found some passage through the lofty mountain defiles; but he had
never been able to discover the passage. Findlay's renewed
descriptions of the immense herds of buffaloes he had seen in
Kentucky, the great salt-licks where they congregated, the
abundance of bears, deer, and elk with which the country teemed,
the innumerable flocks of wild turkeys, geese, and ducks, aroused
in 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Boone the hunter's passion for the chase; while the beauty of
the lands, as mirrored in the vivid fancy of the Irishman,
inspired him with a new longing to explore the famous country
which had, as John Filson records, "greatly engaged Mr. Findlay's
attention."
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_147_2" id="Page_147_2"></a>
In the comprehensive designs of Henderson, now a judge, for
securing a graphic report of the trans-Alleghany region in
behalf of his land company, Boone divined the means of securing
the financial backing for an expedition of considerable size and
ample equipment. 
<a href="#Note_96"><span class="superscript">[96]</span></a>
In numerous suits for debt, aggregating hundreds
of dollars, which had been instituted against Boone by some of
the leading citizens of Rowan, Williams and Henderson had acted
as Boone's attorneys. In order to collect their legal fees, they
likewise brought suit against Boone; but not wishing to press the
action against the kindly scout who had hitherto acted as their
agent in western exploration, they continued the litigation from
court to court, in lieu of certain "conditions performed" on
behalf of Boone, during his unbroken absence, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
by his attorney in this suit, Alexander Martin. 
<a href="#Note_97"><span class="superscript">[97]</span></a>
Summoned to appear in 1769 at the
March term of court at Salisbury, Boone seized upon the occasion
to lay before Judge Henderson the designs for a renewed and
extended exploration of Kentucky suggested by the golden
opportunity of securing the services of Findlay as guide. Shortly
after March 6th, when Judge Henderson reached Salisbury, the
conference, doubtless attended by John Stewart, Boone's
brother-in-law, John Findlay, and Boone, who were all present at
this term of court, must have been held, for the purpose of
devising ways and means for the expedition. Peck, the only
reliable contemporary biographer of the pioneer, who derived many
facts from Boone himself and his intimate acquaintances, draws
the conclusion (1847): "Daniel Boone was engaged as the master
spirit of this exploration, because in his judgment and fidelity
entire confidence could be reposed.&hellip; He was known to
Henderson and encouraged by him to make the exploration, and to
examine particularly the whole country south of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Kentucky&mdash;or as then called the Louisa River." 
<a href="#Note_98"><span class="superscript">[98]</span></a>
As confidential agent of the
land company, Boone carried with him letters and instructions for
his guidance upon this extended tour of exploration.
<a href="#Note_99"><span class="superscript">[99]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
On May 1, 1769, with Findlay as guide, and accompanied by four of
his neighbors, John Stewart, a skilled woodsman, Joseph Holden,
James Mooney, and William Cooley, Boone left his "peaceable
habitation" on the upper Yadkin and began his historic journey
"in quest of the country of Kentucky." Already heavily burdened
with debts, Boone must have incurred considerable further
financial obligations to Judge Henderson and Colonel Williams,
acting for the land company, in order to obtain the large amount
of supplies requisite for so prolonged an expedition. Each of the
adventurers rode a good horse of strength and endurance; and
behind him were securely strapped the blanket, ammunition, salt,
and cooking-utensils so indispensable for a long sojourn in the
wilderness. In Powell's Valley they doubtless encountered the
party led 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
thither by Joseph Martin (see Chapter VII), and there
fell into the "Hunter's Trail" commented on in a letter written
by Martin only a fortnight before the passing of Boone's
cavalcade. Crossing the mountain at the Ouasioto Gap, they made
their first "station camp" in Kentucky on the creek, still named
after that circumstance, on the Red Lick Fork. After a
preliminary journey for the purpose of locating the spot, Findlay
led the party to his old trading-camp at Es-kip-pa-ki-thi-ki,
where then (June 7, 1769) remained but charred embers of the
Indian huts, with some of the stockading and the gate-posts still
standing. In Boone's own words, he and Findlay at once "proceeded
to take a more thorough survey of the country"; and during the
autumn and early winter, encountering on every hand apparently
inexhaustible stocks of wild game and noting the ever-changing
beauties of the country, the various members of the party made
many hunting and exploring journeys from their "station camp" as
base. On December 22, 1769, while 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
engaged in a hunt, Boone and
Stewart were surprised and captured by a large party of
Shawanoes, led by Captain Will, who were returning from the
autumn hunt on Green River to their villages north of the Ohio.
Boone and Stewart were forced to pilot the Indians to their main
camp, where the savages, after robbing them of all their peltries
and supplies and leaving them inferior guns and little
ammunition, set off to the northward. They left, on parting, this
menacing admonition to the white intruders: "Now, brothers, go
home and stay there. Don't come here any more, for this is the
Indians' hunting-ground, and all the animals, skins, and furs are
ours. If you are so foolish as to venture here again, you may be
sure the wasps and yellow jackets will sting you severely."
</p>

<p>
Chagrined particularly by the loss of the horses, Boone and
Stewart for two days pursued the Indians in hot haste. Finally
approaching the Indians' camp by stealth in the dead of night,
they secured two of the horses, upon which they fled at top
speed. In turn 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
they were immediately pursued by a detachment of
the Indians, mounted upon their fleetest horses; and suffered the
humiliation of recapture two days later. Indulging in wild
hilarity over the capture of the crestfallen whites, the Indians
took a bell from one of the horses and, fastening it about
Boone's neck, compelled him under the threat of brandished
tomahawks to caper about and jingle the bell, jeering at him the
while with the derisive query, uttered in broken English: "Steal
horse, eh?" With as good grace as they could summon&mdash;wry smiles
at best&mdash;Boone and Stewart patiently endured these humiliations,
following the Indians as captives. Some days later (about January
4, 1770), while the vigilance of the Indians was momentarily
relaxed, the captives suddenly plunged into a dense cane-brake and
in the subsequent confusion succeeded in effecting their escape.
Finding their camp deserted upon their return, Boone and Stewart
hastened on and finally overtook their companions. Here Boone was
both surprised and delighted to encounter his brother 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
Squire, loaded down with supplies. Having heard nothing from Boone, 
the partners of the land company had surmised that he and his party
must have run short of ammunition, flour, salt, and other things
sorely needed in the wilderness; and because of their desire that
the party should remain, in order to make an exhaustive
exploration of the country, Squire Boone had been sent to him
with supplies. 
<a href="#Note_100"><span class="superscript">[100]</span></a>
Findlay, Holden, Mooney, and Cooley returned to the settlements; 
but Stewart, Squire Boone, and Alexander Neely, who had accompanied 
Squire, threw in their lot with the intrepid Daniel, and fared 
forth once more to the stirring and bracing adventures of the 
Kentucky wilderness. In Daniel Boone's own words, he expected 
"from the furs and peltries they had an opportunity of taking 
&hellip; to recruit his shattered circumstances; discharge the 
debts he had contracted by the adventure; and shortly return 
under better auspices, to settle the newly discovered country."
<a href="#Note_101"><span class="superscript">[101]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Boone and his party now stationed themselves near the mouth of
the Red River, and 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
soon provided themselves, against the hardships of the long winter, 
with jerk, bear's oil, buffalo tallow, dried buffalo tongues, fresh 
meat, and marrow-bones as food, and buffalo robes and bearskins as 
shelter from the inclement weather. Neely had brought with him, to 
while away dull hours, a copy of "Gulliver's Travels"; and in 
describing Neely's successful hunt for buffalo one day, Boone in after 
years amusingly deposed: "In the year 1770 I encamped on Red River with
five other men, and we had with us for our amusement the History
of Samuel Gulliver's Travels, wherein he gave an account of his
young master, Glumdelick, careing him on market day for a show to
a town called Lulbegrud. A young man of our company called
Alexander Neely came to camp and told us he had been that day to
Lulbegrud, and had killed two Brobdignags in their capital." 
<a href="#Note_102"><span class="superscript">[102]</span></a>
Far from unlettered were pioneers who indulged together in such
literary chat and gave to the near-by creek the name (after Dean
Swift's <i>Lorbrulgrud</i>) of Lulbegrud which name, first seen 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
on
Filson's map of Kentucky (1784), it bears to this day. From one
of his long, solitary hunts Stewart never returned; and it was
not until five years later, while cutting out the Transylvania
Trail, that Boone and his companions discovered, near the old
crossing at Rockcastle, Stewart's remains in a standing hollow
sycamore. The wilderness never gave up its tragic secret.
</p>

<p>
The close of the winter and most of the spring were passed by the
Boones, after Neely's return to the settlements, in exploration,
hunting, and trapping beaver and otter, in which sport Daniel
particularly excelled. Owing to the drain upon their ammunition,
Squire was at length compelled to return to the settlements for
supplies; and Daniel, who remained alone in the wilderness to
complete his explorations for the land company, must often have
shared the feelings of Balboa as, from lofty knob or towering
ridge, he gazed over the waste of forest which spread from the
dim outlines of the Alleghanies to the distant waters of the
Mississippi. He now proceeded to 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
make those remarkable solitary
explorations of Kentucky which have given him immortality&mdash;through
the valley of the Kentucky and the Licking, and along the
"Belle Rivi&egrave;re" (Ohio) as low as the falls. He visited the Big
Bone Lick and examined the wonderful fossil remains of the
mammoth found there. Along the great buffalo roads, worn several
feet below the surface of the ground, which led to the Blue
Licks, he saw with amazement and delight thousands of huge shaggy
buffalo gamboling, bellowing, and making the earth rumble beneath
the trampling of their hooves. One day, while upon a cliff near
the junction of the Kentucky and Dick's Rivers, he suddenly found
himself hemmed in by a party of Indians. Seizing his only chance
of escape, he leaped into the top of a maple tree growing beneath
the cliffs and, sliding to safety full sixty feet below, made his
escape, pursued by the sound of a chorus of guttural "Ughs" from
the dumbfounded savages.
</p>

<p>
Finally making his way back to the old camp, Daniel was rejoined
there by Squire 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
on July 27, 1770. During the succeeding months,
much of their time was spent in hunting and prospecting in
Jessamine County, where two caves are still known as Boone's
caves. Eventually, when ammunition and supplies had once more run
low, Squire was compelled a second time to return to the
settlements. Perturbed after a time by Squire's failure to rejoin
him at the appointed time, Daniel started toward the settlements,
in search of him; and by a stroke of good fortune encountered him
along the trail. Overjoyed at this meeting (December, 1770) the
indomitable Boones once more plunged into the wilderness,
determined to conclude their explorations by examining the
regions watered by the Green and Cumberland rivers and their
tributaries. In after years, Gasper Mansker, the old German
scout, was accustomed to describe with comic effect the
consternation created among the Long Hunters, while hunting one
day on Green River, by a singular noise which they could not
explain. Stealthily slipping from tree to tree, Mansker finally
beheld with 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
mingled surprise and amusement a hunter, bare-headed,
stretched flat upon his back on a deerskin spread on the ground,
singing merrily at the top of his voice! It was Daniel Boone,
joyously whiling away the solitary hours in singing one of his
favorite songs of the border. In March, 1771, after spending some
time in company with the Long Hunters, the Boones, their horses
laden with furs, set their faces homeward. On their return
journey, near Cumberland Gap, they had the misfortune to be
surrounded by a party of Indians who robbed them of their guns
and all their peltries. With this humiliating conclusion to his
memorable tour of exploration, Daniel Boone, as he himself says,
"once more reached home after experiencing hardships which would
defy credulity in the recital."
<a href="#Note_103"><span class="superscript">[103]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Despite the hardships and the losses, Boone had achieved the
ambition of years: he had seen Kentucky, which he "esteemed a
second paradise." The reports of his extended explorations, which
he made to Judge Henderson, were soon communicated to the other
partners 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
of the land company; and their letters of this period,
to one another, bristle with glowing and minute descriptions of
the country, as detailed by their agent. Boone was immediately
engaged to act in the company's behalf to sound the Cherokees
confidentially with respect to their willingness to lease or sell
the beautiful hunting-grounds of the trans-Alleghany. 
<a href="#Note_104"><span class="superscript">[104]</span></a>
The high
hopes of Henderson and his associates at last gave promise of
brilliant realization. Daniel Boone's glowing descriptions of
Kentucky excited in their minds, says a gifted early chronicler,
the "spirit of an enterprise which in point of magnitude and
peril, as well as constancy and heroism displayed in its
execution, has never been paralleled in the history of America."

to the Inhabitants of Granville County, containing an Account of our
deplorable Situation we suffer &hellip; and some necessary Hints with
Respect to a Reformation</i>. June 6, 1765.
</p>

<br>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> 
is highly probable that even at 
the time of his earlier explorations in behalf of Richard Henderson 
and Company, Daniel
Boone anticipated speedy removal to the West. Indeed, in the very
year of his first tour in their interest, Daniel and his wife
Rebeckah sold all their property in North Carolina, consisting of
their home and six hundred and forty 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
acres of land, and after several removals established themselves 
upon the upper Yadkin. This removal and the later western 
explorations just outlined were due not merely to the spirit of 
adventure and discovery. Three other causes also were at work. 
In the first place there was the scarcity of game. For fifteen 
years the shipments of deerskins from Bethabara to Charleston 
steadily increased; and the number of skins bought by Gammern, 
the Moravian storekeeper, ran so high that in spite of the 
large purchases made at the store by the hunters he would 
sometimes run entirely out of money. Tireless in the chase, 
the far-roaming Boone was among "the hunters, who brought in 
their skins from as far away as the Indian lands"; and the 
beautiful upland pastures and mountain forests, still teeming 
with deer and bear, doubtless lured him to the upper Yadkin, 
where for a time in the immediate neighborhood of his home 
abundance of game fell before his unerring rifle. Certainly 
the deer and other game, which were being killed in
enormous numbers to satisfy the insatiable 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
demand of the traders at Salisbury, the Forks, and Bethabara, became 
scarcer and scarcer; and the wild game that was left gradually fled 
to the westward. Terrible indeed was the havoc wrought among the elk;
and it was reported that the last elk was killed in western North
Carolina as early as 1781.
</p>

<p>
Another grave evil of the time with which Boone had to cope in
the back country of North Carolina was the growth of undisguised
outlawry, similar to that found on the western plains of a later
era. This ruthless brigandage arose as the result of the
unsettled state of the country and the exposed condition of the
settlements due to the Indian alarms. When rude borderers,
demoralized by the enforced idleness attendant upon fort life
during the dark days of Indian invasion, sallied forth upon
forays against the Indians, they found much valuable
property&mdash;horses, cattle, and stock&mdash;left by their owners when
hurriedly fleeing to the protection of the frontier stockades.
The temptations thus afforded were too great to resist; and the
wilder spirits of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
backwoods, with hazy notions of private
rights, seized the property which they found, slaughtered the
cattle, sold the horses, and appropriated to their own use the
temporarily abandoned household goods and plantation tools. The
stealing of horses, which were needed for the cultivation of the
soil and useful for quickly carrying unknown thieves beyond the
reach of the owner and the law, became a common practice; and was
carried on by bands of outlaws living remote from one another and
acting in collusive concert.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of July, 1755, when the Indian outrages upon the
New River settlements in Virginia had frightened away all the
families at the Town Fork in the Yadkin country, William Owen, a
man of Welsh stock, who had settled in the spring of 1752 in the
upper Yadkin near the Mulberry Fields, was suspected of having
robbed the storekeeper on the Meho. Not long afterward a band of
outlaws who plundered the exposed cabins in their owners'
absence, erected a rude fort in the mountain region in the rear
of the Yadkin 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
settlements, where they stored their ill-gotten
plunder and made themselves secure from attack. Other members of
the band dwelt in the settlements, where they concealed their
robber friends by day and aided them by night in their nefarious
projects of theft and rapine.
</p>

<p>
The entire community was finally aroused by the bold depredations
of the outlaws; and the most worthy settlers of the Yadkin
country organized under the name of Regulators to break up the
outlaw band. When it was discovered that Owen, who was well known
at Bethabara, had allied himself with the highwaymen, one of the
justices summoned one hundred men; and seventy, who answered the
call, set forth on December 26, 1755, to seek out the outlaws and
to destroy their fortress. Emboldened by their success, the
latter upon one occasion had carried off a young girl of the
settlements. Daniel Boone placed himself at the head of one of
the parties, which included the young girl's father, to go to her
rescue; and they fortunately succeeded in effecting the release
of the frightened maiden. One of 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
the robbers was apprehended and brought to Salisbury, where he was thrown 
into prison for his crimes. Meanwhile a large amount of plunder had been 
discovered at the house of one Cornelius Howard; and the evidences of his
guilt so multiplied against him that he finally confessed his
connection with the outlaw band and agreed to point out their
fort in the mountains.
</p>

<p>
Daniel Boone and George Boone joined the party of seventy men,
sent out by the colonial authorities, under the guidance of
Howard, to attack the stronghold of the bandits. Boone afterward
related that the robbers' fort was situated in the most fitly
chosen place for such a purpose that he could imagine&mdash;beneath an
overhanging cliff of rock, with a large natural chimney, and a
considerable area in front well stockaded. The frontiersmen
surrounded the fort, captured five women and eleven children, and
then burned the fort to the ground. Owen and his wife,
Cumberland, and several others were ultimately made prisoners;
but Harman and the remainder of the band escaped by 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
flight. Owen and his fellow captives were then borne to Salisbury,
incarcerated in the prison there, and finally (May, 1756)
condemned to the gallows. Owen sent word to the Moravians,
petitioning them to adopt his two boys and to apprentice one to a
tailor, the other to a carpenter. But so infuriated was Owen's
wife by Howard's treachery that she branded him as a second
Judas; and this at once fixed upon him the sobriquet "Judas"
Howard&mdash;a sobriquet he did not live long to bear, for about a year
later he was ambushed and shot from his horse at the crossing of
a stream. He thus paid the penalty of his betrayal of the outlaw
band. For a number of years, the Regulators continued to wage war
against the remaining outlaws, who from time to time committed
murders as well as thefts. As late as January, 1768, the
Regulators caught a horse thief in the Hollows of Surry County
and brought him to Bethabara, whence Richter and Spach took him
to the jail at Salisbury. After this year, the outlaws were 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
heard of no more; and peace reigned in the settlements.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Edmund Fanning&mdash;of whom more anon&mdash;declared that the
Regulation began in Anson County which bordered upon South
Carolina. 
<a href="#Note_105"><span class="superscript">[105]</span></a>
Certain it is that the upper country of that province
was kept in an uproar by civil disturbances during this early
period. Owing to the absence of courts in this section, so remote
from Charleston, the inhabitants found it necessary, for the
protection of property and the punishment of outlaws, to form an
association called, like the North Carolina society, the
Regulation. Against this association the horse thieves and other
criminals made common cause, and received tacit support from
certain more reputable persons who condemned "the irregularity of
the Regulators." The Regulation which had been thus organized in
upper South Carolina as early as 1764 led to tumultuous risings
of the settlers; and finally in the effort to suppress these
disorders, the governor, Lord Charles Montagu, appointed 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
one
Scovil, an utterly unworthy representative, to carry out his
commands. After various disorders, which became ever more
unendurable to the law-abiding, matters came to a crisis (1769)
as the result of the high-handed proceedings of Scovil, who
promiscuously seized and flung into prison all the Regulators he
could lay hands on. In the month of March the back country rose
in revolt against Scovil and a strong body of the settlers was on
the point of attacking the force under his command when an
eleventh-hour letter arrived from Montagu, dismissing Scovil from
office. Thus was happily averted, by the narrowest of margins, a
threatened precursor of the fight at Alamance in 1771 (see
Chapter XII). As the result of the petition of the Calhouns and
others, courts were established in 1760, though not opened until
four years later. Many horse thieves were apprehended, tried, and
punished. Justice once more held full sway.
</p>

<p>
Another important cause for Boone's removal from the neighborhood
of Salisbury into 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the mountain fastnesses was the oppressive
administration of the law by corrupt sheriffs, clerks, and
tax-gatherers, and the dissatisfaction of the frontier squatters
with the owners of the soil. At the close of the year 1764
reports reached the town of Wilmington, after the adjournment of
the assembly in November, of serious disturbances in Orange
County, due, it was alleged, to the exorbitant exactions of the
clerks, registers, and some of the attorneys. 
<a href="#Note_106"><span class="superscript">[106]</span></a>
As a result of this
disturbing news, Governor Dobbs issued a proclamation forbidding
any officer to take illegal fees. Troubles had been brewing in
the adjacent county of Granville ever since the outbreak of the
citizens against Francis Corbin, Lord Granville's agent (January
24, 1759), and the issuance of the petition of Reuben Searcy and
others (March 23d) protesting against the alleged excessive fees
taken and injustices practised by Robert (Robin) Jones, the
famous lawyer. These disturbances were cumulative in their
effect; and the people at last (1765) found in George Sims, of
Granville, a fit 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
spokesman of their cause and a doughty champion
of popular rights. In his "Serious Address to the Inhabitants of
Granville County, containing an Account of our deplorable
Situation we suffer &hellip; and some necessary Hints with Respect
to a Reformation," recently brought to light, he presents a
crushing indictment of the clerk of the county court, Samuel
Benton, the grandfather of Thomas Hart Benton. After describing
in detail the system of semi-peonage created by the merciless
exactions of lawyers and petty court officials, and the
insatiable greed of "these cursed hungry caterpillars," Sims with
rude eloquence calls upon the people to pull them down from their
nests for the salvation of the Commonwealth.
<a href="#Note_107"><span class="superscript">[107]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Other abuses were also recorded. So exorbitant was the charge for
a marriage-license, for instance, that an early chronicler
records: "The consequence was that some of the inhabitants on the
head-waters of the Yadkin took a short cut. They took each other
for better or for worse; and considered themselves as 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
married without further ceremony." The extraordinary scarcity of currency
throughout the colony, especially in the back country, was
another great hardship and a perpetual source of vexation. All
these conditions gradually became intolerable to the uncultured
but free-spirited men of the back country. Events were slowly
converging toward a crisis in government and society. Independent
in spirit, turbulent in action, the backwoodsmen revolted not
only against excessive taxes, dishonest sheriffs, and
extortionate fees, but also against the rapacious practices of
the agents of Lord Granville. These agents industriously picked
flaws in the titles to the lands in Granville's proprietary upon
which the poorer settlers were seated; and compelled them to pay
for the land if they had not already done so, or else to pay the
fees twice over and take out a new patent as the only remedy of
the alleged defect in their titles. In Mecklenburg County the
spirit of backwoods revolt flamed out in protest against the
proprietary agents. Acting under instructions to survey and close
bargains 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
for the lands or else to eject those who held them,
Henry Eustace McCulloh, in February, 1765, went into the county
to call a reckoning. The settlers, many of whom had located
without deeds, indignantly retorted by offering to buy only at
their own prices, and forbade the surveyors to lay out the
holdings when this smaller price was declined. They not only
terrorized into acquiescence those among them who were willing to
pay the amount charged for the lands, but also openly declared
that they would resist by force any sheriff in ejectment
proceedings. On May 7th an outbreak occurred; and a mob, led by
Thomas Polk, set upon John Frohock, Abraham Alexander, and
others, as they were about to survey a parcel of land, and gave
them a severe thrashing, even threatening the young McCulloh with
death.
<a href="#Note_108"><span class="superscript">[108]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The choleric backwoodsmen, instinctively in agreement with
Francis Bacon, considered revenge as a sort of wild justice.
Especial objects of their animosity were the brothers Frohock,
John and Thomas, the latter clerk of the court at Salisbury, and
Edmund Fanning, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
a cultured gentleman-adventurer, associate
justice of the superior court. So rapacious and extortionate were
these vultures of the courts who preyed upon the vitals of the
common people, that they were savagely lampooned by Rednap
Howell, the backwoods poet-laureate of the Regulation. The temper
of the back country is well caught in Howell's lines anent this
early American "grafter," the favorite of the royal governor:

<p>
The germs of the great westward migration in the coming decade
were thus working among the people of the back country. If the
tense nervous energy of the American people is the transmitted
characteristic of the border settlers, who often slept with
loaded rifle in hand 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
in grim expectation of being awakened by the
hideous yells, the deadly tomahawk, and the lurid firebrand of
the savage, the very buoyancy of the national character is in
equal measure "traceable to the free democracy founded on a
freehold inheritance of land." The desire for free land was the
fundamental factor in the development of the American democracy.
No colony exhibited this tendency more signally than did North
Carolina in the turbulent days of the Regulation. The North
Carolina frontiersmen resented the obligation to pay quit-rents
and firmly believed that the first occupant of the soil had an
indefeasible right to the land which he had won with his rifle
and rendered productive by the implements of toil. Preferring the
dangers of the free wilderness to the paying of tribute to
absentee landlords and officials of an intolerant colonial
government, the frontiersman found title in his trusty rifle
rather than in a piece of parchment, and was prone to pay his
obligations to the owner of the soil in lead rather than in gold.

The Regulators despaired of seeing better times and therefore

five years (1766-1771) which saw 
the rise, development, and ultimate defeat of the popular movement 
known as the Regulation,
constitute a period not only of extraordinary significance in
North Carolina but also of fruitful consequences in the larger
movements of westward expansion. With the resolute intention of
having their rulers "give account of their stewardship," to
employ their own words, the Sandy Creek Association of Baptists
(organized in 1758), in a series of papers known as Regulators'
Advertisements (1766-8) proceeded to mature, through popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
gatherings, a rough form of initiative and referendum. At length,
discouraged in its efforts, and particularly in the attempt to
bring county officials to book for charging illegal fees, this
association ceased actively to function. It was the precursor of
a movement of much more drastic character and formidable
proportions, chiefly directed against Colonel Edmund Fanning and
his associates. This movement doubtless took its name, "the
Regulation," from the bands of men already described who were
organized first in North Carolina and later in South Carolina, to
put down highwaymen and to correct many abuses in the back
country, such as the tyrannies of Scovil and his henchmen.
Failing to secure redress of their grievances through legal
channels, the Regulators finally made such a powerful
demonstration in support of their refusal to pay taxes that
Governor William Tryon of North Carolina, in 1768, called out the
provincial militia, and by marching with great show of force
through the disaffected regions, succeeded temporarily in
overawing the people 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and thus inducing them to pay their
assessments.
<a href="#Note_110"><span class="superscript">[110]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The suits which had been brought by the Regulators against Edmund
Fanning, register, and Francis Nash, clerk, of Orange County,
resulted in both being "found guilty of taking too high fees."
<a href="#Note_111"><span class="superscript">[111]</span></a>
Fanning immediately resigned his commission as register; while
Nash, who in conjunction with Fanning had fairly offered in 1766
to refund to any one aggrieved any fee charged by him which the
Superior Court might hold excessive, gave bond for his appearance
at the next court. Similar suits for extortion against the three
Frohocks in Rowan County in 1769 met with failure, however; and
this outcome aroused the bitter resentment of the Regulators, as
recorded by Herman Husband in his "Impartial Relation." During
this whole period the insurrectionary spirit of the people, who
felt themselves deeply aggrieved but recognized their inability
to secure redress, took the form of driving local justices from
the bench and threatening court officials with violence.

At the session of the Superior Court at Hillsborough, September
22, 1770, an elaborate petition prepared by the Regulators,
demanding unprejudiced juries and the public accounting for taxes
by the sheriffs, was handed to the presiding justice by James
Hunter, a leading Regulator. This justice was our acquaintance,
Judge Richard Henderson, of Granville County, the sole high
officer in the provincial government from the entire western
section of the colony. In this petition occur these trenchant
words: "As we are serious and in good earnest and the cause
respects the whole body of the people it would be loss of time to
enter into arguments on particular points for though there are a
few men who have the gift and art of reasoning, yet every man has
a feeling and knows when he has justice done him as well as the
most learned." 
<a href="#Note_112"><span class="superscript">[112]</span></a>
On the following Monday (September 24th), upon
convening of court, some one hundred and fifty Regulators, led by
James Hunter, Herman Husband, Rednap Howell, and others, armed
with clubs, whips, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and cudgels, surged into the court-room and
through their spokesman, Jeremiah Fields, presented a statement
of their grievances. "I found myself," says Judge Henderson,
"under a necessity of attempting to soften and turn away the fury
of these mad people, in the best manner in my power, and as such
could well be, pacify their rage and at the same time preserve
the little remaining dignity of the court."
<a href="#Note_113"><span class="superscript">[113]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
During an interim, in which the Regulators retired for
consultation, they fell without warning upon Fanning and gave him
such rough treatment that he narrowly escaped with his life. The
mob, now past control, horsewhipped a number of leading lawyers
and citizens gathered there at court, and treated others, notably
the courtly Mr. Hooper of Boston, "with every mark of contempt
and insult." Judge Henderson was assured by Fields that no harm
should come to him provided he would conduct the court in
accordance with the behest of the Regulators: namely, that no
lawyer, save the King's Attorney, should be admitted 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
to the court, and that the Regulators' cases should be tried with new
jurors chosen by the Regulators. With the entire little village
terrorized by this campaign of "frightfulness," and the court
wholly unprotected, Judge Henderson reluctantly acknowledged to
himself that "the power of the judiciary was exhausted."
Nevertheless, he says, "I made every effort in my power
consistent with my office and the duty the public is entitled to
claim to preserve peace and good order." 
<a href="#Note_114"><span class="superscript">[114]</span></a>
Agreeing under duress to resume the session the following day, 
the judge ordered an adjournment. But being unwilling, on mature 
reflection, to permit a mockery of the court and a travesty of 
justice to be staged under threat and intimidation, he returned 
that night to his home in Granville and left the court adjourned 
in course. Enraged by the judge's escape, the Regulators took 
possession of the court-room the following morning, called over 
the cases, and in futile protest against the conditions they were 
powerless to remedy, made profane entries which may still be seen on the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
record: "Damned rogues," "Fanning pays cost but loses nothing," "Negroes
not worth a damn, Cost exceeds the whole," "Hogan pays and be
damned," and, in a case of slander, "Nonsense, let them argue for
Ferrell has gone hellward."
<a href="#Note_115"><span class="superscript">[115]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The uprising of these bold and resolute, simple and imperfectly
educated people, which had begun as a constitutional struggle to
secure justice and to prevent their own exploitation by dishonest
lawyers of the county courts, now gave place to open anarchy and
secret incendiarism. 
<a href="#Note_116"><span class="superscript">[116]</span></a>
In the dead of night, November 12th and
14th, Judge Henderson's barn, stables, and dwelling house were
fired by the Regulators and went up in flames. Glowing with a
sense of wrong, these misguided people, led on by fanatical
agitators, thus vented their indiscriminate rage, not only upon
their oppressors, but also upon men wholly innocent of injuring
them&mdash;men of the stamp of William Hooper, afterward signer of the
Declaration of Independence, Alexander Martin, afterward governor
and United States Senator, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
and Richard Henderson, popular representative of the back country 
and a firm champion of due
process of law. It is perhaps not surprising in view of these
events that Governor Tryon and the ruling class, lacking a
sympathy broad enough to ensure justice to the oppressed people,
seemed to be chiefly impressed with the fact that a widespread
insurrection was in progress, threatening not only life and
property, but also civil government itself. The governor called
out the militia of the province and led an army of well-nigh one
thousand men and officers against the Regulators, who had
assembled at Alamance to the number of two thousand. Tryon stood
firm upon the demands that the people should submit to government
and disperse at a designated hour. The Regulators, on their side,
hoped to secure the reforms they desired by intimidating the
governor with a great display of force. The battle was a tragic
fiasco for the Regulators, who fought bravely, but without
adequate arms or real leadership. With the conclusion of this
desultory action, a 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
fight lasting about two hours (May 16, 1771),
the power of the Regulators was completely broken.
<a href="#Note_117"><span class="superscript">[117]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Among these insurgents there was a remarkable element&mdash;an element
whose influence upon the course of American history has been but
imperfectly understood&mdash;which now looms into prominence as the
vanguard of the army of westward expansion. There were some of
the Regulators who, though law-abiding and conservative, were
deeply imbued with ideas of liberty, personal independence, and
the freedom of the soil. Through the influence of Benjamin
Franklin, with whom one of the leaders of the group, Herman
Husband, was in constant correspondence, the patriotic ideas then
rapidly maturing into revolutionary sentiments furnished the
inspiration to action. As early as 1766, the Sandy Creek leaders,
referred to earlier in this chapter, issued a call to each
neighborhood to send delegates to a gathering for the purpose of
investigating the question "whether the free men of this country
labor under any abuses of power or not." The 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
close connection
between the Sandy Creek men and the Sons of Liberty is amply
demonstrated in this paper wherein the Sons of Liberty in
connection with the "stamp law" are praised for "redeeming us
from Tyranny" and for having "withstood the lords in Parliament
in behalf of true liberty." 
<a href="#Note_118"><span class="superscript">[118]</span></a>
Upon the records of the Dutchman's
Creek Church, of "regular" Baptists, at the Forks of the Yadkin,
to which Daniel Boone's family belonged, may be found this
memorable entry, recognizing the "American Cause" well-nigh a
year before the declaration of independence at Philadelphia: "At
the monthly meeting it was agreed upon concerning the American
Cause, if any of the brethren see cause to join it they have the
liberty to do it without being called to an account by the
church. But whether they join or do not join they should be used
with brotherly love."
<a href="#Note_119"><span class="superscript">[119]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The fundamental reasons underlying the approaching westward
hegira are found in the remarkable petition of the Regulators of
Anson County (October 9, 1769), who request 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
that "Benjamin Franklin or some other known <em>patriot</em>" be 
appointed agent of the province in London to seek redress at the 
source. They exposed the basic evil in the situation by pointing 
out that, in violation of the law restricting the amount of land 
that might be granted to each person to six hundred and forty 
acres, much of the most fertile territory in the province had been 
distributed in large tracts to wealthy landlords. In consequence 
"great numbers of poor people are necessitated to toil in the
cultivation of the bad Lands whereon they hardly can subsist." 
<a href="#Note_120"><span class="superscript">[120]</span></a>
It was these poor people, "thereby deprived of His Majesties
liberality and Bounty," who soon turned their gaze to the
westward and crossed the mountains in search of the rich, free
lands of the trans-Alleghany region.
</p>

<p>
This feverish popular longing for freedom, stimulated by the
economic pressure of thousands of pioneers who were annually
entering North Carolina, set in motion a wave of migration across
the mountains in 1769. Long before Alamance, many of the true
Americans, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
distraught by apparently irremediable injustices,
plunged fearlessly into the wilderness, seeking beyond the
mountains a new birth of liberty, lands of their own selection
free of cost or quit-rents, and a government of their own
choosing and control. 
<a href="#Note_121"><span class="superscript">[121]</span></a>
The glad news of the rich valleys beyond
the mountains early lured such adventurous pioneers as Andrew
Greer and Julius C&aelig;sar Dugger to the Watauga country. The
glowing stories, told by Boone, and disseminated in the back
country by Henderson, Williams, and the Harts, seemed to give
promise to men of this stamp that the West afforded relief from
oppressions suffered in North Carolina. During the winter of
1768-9 there was also a great rush of settlers from Virginia into
the valley of the Holston. A party from Augusta County, led by
men who had been delighted with the country viewed seven years
before when they were serving under Colonel William Byrd against
the Cherokees, found that this region, a wilderness on their
outward passage in 1768, was dotted with cabins on every spot
where the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
grazing was good, upon their return the following year.
Writing to Hillsborough on October 18, 1770, concerning the "many
hundred families" in the region from Green River to the branches
of the Holston, who refused to comply with the royal proclamation
of 1763, Acting-Governor Nelson of Virginia reports that "very
little if any Quit Rents have been received for His Majesty's use
from that Quarter for some time past"&mdash;the people claiming that
"His Majesty hath been pleased to withdraw his protection from
them since 1763."
<a href="#Note_122"><span class="superscript">[122]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1770, with the express intention of discovering
suitable locations for homes for himself and a number of others,
who wished to escape the accumulating evils of the times, James
Robertson of Orange County, North Carolina, made an arduous
journey to the pleasing valley of the Watauga. Robertson, who was
born in Brunswick County, Virginia, June 28, 1742, of excellent
Scotch-Irish ancestry, was a noteworthy figure of a certain
type&mdash;quiet, reflective, conservative, wise, a 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
firm believer in the
basic principles of civil liberty and the right of local
self-government. Robertson spent some time with a man named
Honeycut in the Watauga region, raised a crop of corn, and chose
for himself and his friends suitable locations for settlement.
Lost upon his return in seeking the mountain defiles traversed by
him on the outward journey, Robertson probably escaped death from
starvation only through the chance passing of two hunters who
succored him and set him upon the right path. On arriving in
Orange he found political and social conditions there much worse
than before, many of the colonists declining to take the
obligatory oath of allegiance to the British Crown after the
Battle of Alamance, preferring to carve out for themselves new
homes along the western waters. Some sixteen families of this
stamp, indignant at the injustices and oppressions of British
rule, and stirred by Robertson's description of the richness and
beauty of the western country, accompanied him to Watauga shortly
after the battle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
This vanguard of the army of westward advance, independent
Americans in spirit with a negligible sprinkling of Loyalists,
now swept in a great tide into the northeastern section of
Tennessee. The men of Sandy Creek, actuated by independent
principles but out of sympathy with the anarchic side of the
Regulation, left the colony almost to a man. "After the defeat of
the Regulators," says the historian of the Sandy Creek
Association, "thousands of the oppressed, seeing no hope of
redress for their grievances, moved into and settled east
Tennessee. A large proportion of these were of the Baptist
population. Sandy Creek Church which some time previous to 1771,
numbered 606, was afterward reduced to fourteen members!" 
<a href="#Note_123"><span class="superscript">[123]</span></a>
This movement exerted powerful influence in stimulating westward
expansion. Indeed, it was from men of Regulating principles&mdash;Boone,
Robertson, and the Searcys&mdash;who vehemently condemned the
anarchy and incendiarism of 1770, that Judge Henderson received
powerful co&ouml;peration in 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the opening up of Kentucky and Tennessee.
<a href="#Note_124"><span class="superscript">[124]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The several treaties concerning the western boundary of white
settlement, concluded in close succession by North Carolina,
Virginia, and the Crown with the Southern and Northern Indians,
had an important bearing upon the settlement of Watauga. The
Cherokee boundary line, as fixed by Governor Tryon (1767) and by
John Stuart (1768), ran from Reedy River to Tryon Mountain,
thence straight to Chiswell's Mine, and thence direct to the
mouth of the Great Kanawha River. By the treaty at Fort Stanwix
(November 5, 1768), in the negotiation of which Virginia was
represented by Dr. Thomas Walker and Major Andrew Lewis, the Six
Nations sold to the Crown their shadowy claim to a vast tract of
western country, including in particular all the land between the
Ohio and the Tennessee Rivers. The news of the cession resulted
in a strong southwestward thrust of population, from the
neighborhood of Abingdon, in the direction of the Holston 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Valley.
<a href="#Note_125"><span class="superscript">[125]</span></a>
Recognizing that hundreds of these settlers were beyond the line
negotiated by Stuart, but on lands not yet surveyed, Governor
Botetourt instructed the Virginia commissioners to press for
further negotiations, through Stuart, with the Cherokees.
Accordingly, on October 18, 1770, a new treaty was made at
Lochaber, South Carolina, by which a new line back of Virginia
was established, beginning at the intersection of the North
Carolina-Cherokee line (a point some seventy-odd miles east of
Long Island), running thence in a west course to a point six
miles east of Long Island, and thence in a direct course to the
confluence of the Great Kanawha and Ohio Rivers. At the time of
the treaty, it was agreed that the Holston River, from its
intersection with the North Carolina-Virginia line, and down the
course of the same, should be a temporary southern boundary of
Virginia until the line should be ascertained by actual survey. 
<a href="#Note_126"><span class="superscript">[126]</span></a>
A strong influx of population into the immense new triangle thus
released for settlement 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
brought powerful pressure to bear upon
northern Tennessee, the point of least resistance along the
western barrier. Singularly enough, this advance was not opposed
by the Cherokees, whose towns were strung across the extreme
southeast corner of Tennessee.
</p>

<p>
When Colonel John Donelson ran the line in the latter part of
1771, The Little Carpenter, who with other Indian chiefs
accompanied the surveying party, urged that the line agreed upon
at Lochaber should break off at the head of the Louisa River, and
should run thence to the mouth thereof, and thence up the Ohio to
the mouth of the Great Kanawha. For this increase in the
territory of Virginia they of course expected additional payment.
As a representative of Virginia, Donelson agreed to the proposed
alteration in the boundary line; and accordingly promised to send
the Cherokees, in the following spring, a sum alleged by them to
have been fixed at five hundred pounds, in compensation for the
additional area. This informal agreement, it is 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
believed, was never ratified by Virginia; nor was the promised 
compensation ever paid the Cherokees.
<a href="#Note_127"><span class="superscript">[127]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_194_2" id="Page_194_2"></a>
Under the belief that the land belonged to Virginia, Jacob Brown
with one or two families from North Carolina settled in 1771 upon
a tract of land on the northern bank of the Nonachunheh
(corruption, Nolichucky) River. During the same year, an
experimental line run westward from Steep Rock and Beaver Creek
by Anthony Bledsoe showed that upon the extension of the boundary
line, these settlers would fall within the bounds of North
Carolina. Although thus informally warned of the situation, the
settlers made no move to vacate the lands. But in the following
year, after the running of Donelson's line, Alexander Cameron,
Stuart's deputy, required "all persons who had made settlements
beyond the said line to relinquish them." Thus officially warned,
Brown and his companions removed to Watauga. 
<a href="#Note_128"><span class="superscript">[128]</span></a>
Cameron's order did
not apply, however, to the settlement north of the Holston River, 
south and east of Long Island; and the settlement in Carter's 
Valley, north of the Holston and west of the Long Island, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
although lying without the Virginia boundary, strangely enough remained 
unmolested. The order was directed at the Watauga settlers, who were 
seated south of the Holston River in the Watauga Valley.
</p>

<p>
The plight in which the Watauga settlers now found themselves was
truly desperate; and the way in which they surmounted this
apparently insuperable difficulty is one of the most striking and
characteristic events in the pre-Revolutionary history of the Old
Southwest. It exhibits the indomitable will and fertile resource
of the American character at the margin of desperation. The
momentous influence of the Watauga settlers, inadequately
reckoned hitherto by historians, was soon to make itself
powerfully felt in the first epochal movement of westward
expansion.

was fortunate for the Watauga 
settlers that the Indians and the whites were on the most peaceful 
terms with each other at the time the Watauga Valley was shown, 
by the running of the boundary line, to lie within the Indian 
reservation. With true American self-reliance, the settlers met 
together for deliberation and counsel, and deputed James Robertson

In taking this daring step, the Watauga settlers moved into the
spotlight of national history. For the inevitable consequence of
leasing the territory was the organization of a form of
government for the infant settlement. Through his familiarity
with the North Carolina type of "association," in which the
settlers had organized for the purpose of "regulating" abuses,
and his acquaintance with the contents of the "Impartial
Relation," in which Husband fully expounded the principles and
practices of this association, Robertson was peculiarly fitted
for leadership in organizing this new government. The convention
at which Articles of Association, unfortunately lost, were drawn
up, is noteworthy as the first 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
governmental assemblage of
free-born American citizens ever held west of the Alleghanies.
The government then established was the first free and
independent government, democratic in spirit, representative in
form, ever organized upon the American continent. In describing
this mimic republic, the royal Governor of Virginia says: "They
appointed magistrates, and framed laws for their present
occasion, and to all intents and purposes, erected themselves
into, though an inconsiderable, yet a separate State." 
<a href="#Note_130"><span class="superscript">[130]</span></a>
The most daring spirit in this little state was the young John 
Sevier, of French Huguenot family (originally spelled Xavier), 
born in Augusta County, Virginia, on September 23, 1745. It was 
from Millerstown in Shenandoah County where he was living the
uneventful life of a small farmer, that he emigrated (December,
1773) to the Watauga region. With his arrival there begins one of
the most fascinating and romantic careers recorded in the varied
and stirring annals of the Old Southwest. In this daring and
impetuous young fellow, fair-haired, blue-eyed, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
magnetic, debonair&mdash;of powerful build, splendid proportions, 
and athletic skill&mdash;we hold the gallant exemplar of the truly 
heroic life of the border. The story of his life, thrilling in the 
extreme, is rich in all the multi-colored elements which impart 
romance to the arduous struggle of American civilization in the 
opening years of the republic.
</p>

<p>
The creative impulses in the Watauga commonwealth are hinted at
by Dunmore, who observes, in the letter above quoted, that Watauga
"sets a dangerous example to the people America, of forming
governments distinct from and independent of his Majesty's
authority." It is true that the experiment was somewhat limited. 
The organization of the Watauga association, which constituted a
temporary expedient to meet a crisis in the affairs of a frontier
community cut off by forest wilderness and mountain barriers from
the reach of the arm of royal or provincial government, is not to
be compared with the revolutionary assemblage at Boonesborough,
May 23, 1775, or with the extraordinary demands for independence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, during the same month.
Nevertheless the Watauga settlers defied both North Carolina and
the Crown, by adopting the laws of Virginia and by ignoring
Governor Josiah Martin's proclamation (March 26, 1774) "requiring
the said settlers immediately to retire from the Indian
Territories." 
<a href="#Note_131"><span class="superscript">[131]</span></a>
Moreover, Watauga really was the parent of a series
of mimic republics in the Old Southwest, gradually tending toward
higher forms of organization, with a larger measure of individual
liberty. Watauga, Transylvania, Cumberland, Franklin represent
the evolving political genius of a free people under the creative
leadership of three constructive minds&mdash;James Robertson, John
Sevier, and Richard Henderson. Indeed, Watauga furnished to Judge
Henderson precisely the "dangerous example" of which Dunmore
prophetically speaks.
<a href="#Note_132"><span class="superscript">[132]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Immediately upon his return in 1771 from the extended exploration
of Kentucky, Daniel Boone as already noted was engaged as secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
agent, to treat with the Cherokees for the lease or purchase of
the trans-Alleghany region, on behalf of Judge Henderson and his
associates. Embroiled in the exciting issues of the Regulation
and absorbed by his confining duties as colonial judge, Henderson
was unable to put his bold design into execution until after the
expiration of the court itself which ceased to exist in 1773.
Disregarding the royal proclamation of 1763 and Locke's
Fundamental Constitutions for the Carolinas, which forbade
private parties to purchase lands from the Indians, Judge
Henderson applied to the highest judicial authorities in England
to know if there was any law in existence forbidding purchase of
lands from the Indian tribes. Lord Mansfield gave Judge Henderson
the "sanction of his great authority in favor of the purchase."
<a href="#Note_133"><span class="superscript">[133]</span></a>
Lord Chancellor Camden and Mr. Yorke had officially advised the
King in 1757, in regard to the petition of the East Indian
Company, "that in respect to such territories as have been, or
shall be acquired by treaty or 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
grant from the Great Mogul, or any of the Indian princes or governments, 
your Majesty's letters patent are <em>not necessary</em>; the property of 
the soil vesting in the company by the Indian grant subject only to your 
Majesties right of sovereignty over the settlements, as English 
settlements, and over the inhabitants, as English subjects, who carry 
with them your Majesties laws wherever they form colonies, and receive 
your Majesties protection by virtue of your royal charters." 
<a href="#Note_134"><span class="superscript">[134]</span></a>
This opinion, with virtually no change, was rendered in regard to the
Indian tribes of North America by the same two authorities,
certainly as early as 1769; 
<a href="#Note_135"><span class="superscript">[135]</span></a>
and a true copy, made in London, April 1, 1772, was transmitted to 
Judge Henderson. 
<a href="#Note_136"><span class="superscript">[136]</span></a>
Armed with the legal opinions received from England, Judge Henderson 
was fully persuaded that there was no legal bar whatsoever to his 
seeking to acquire by purchase from the Cherokees the vast domain 
of the trans-Alleghany. 
<a href="#Note_137"><span class="superscript">[137]</span></a>
A golden dream of empire, with its promise of an
independent republic in the form of a proprietary colony, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
casts him under the spell of its alluring glamour.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the restless Boone, impatient over the delay in
the consummation of Judge Henderson's plans, resolved to
establish himself in Kentucky upon his own responsibility.
Heedless of the question of title and the certain hazards
incident to invading the territory of hostile savages, Boone
designated a rendezvous in Powell's Valley where he and his party
of five families were to be met by a band under the leadership of
his connections, the Bryans, and another company led by Captain
William Russell, a daring pioneer of the Clinch Valley. A small
detachment of Boone's party was fiercely attacked by Shawanoes in
Powell's Valley on October 10, 1773, and almost all were killed,
including sons of Boone and Russell, and young John and Richard
Mendenhall of Guilford County, North Carolina. As the result of
this bloody repulse, Boone's attempt to settle in Kentucky at
this time was definitely abandoned. His failure to effect a
settlement in Kentucky was due to that 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
characteristic disregard
of the territorial rights of the Indians which was all too common
among the borderers of that period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_204_2" id="Page_204_2"></a>
This failure was portentous of the coming storm. The reign of the
Long Hunters was over. Dawning upon the horizon was the day of
stern adventurers, fixed in the desperate and lawless resolve to
invade the trans-Alleghany country and to battle savagely with
the red man for its possession. More successful than Boone was
the McAfee party, five in number, from Botetourt County,
Virginia, who between May 10th and September 1, 1773, safely
accomplished a journey through Kentucky and carefully marked
well-chosen sites for future location.
<a href="#Note_138"><span class="superscript">[138]</span></a>
An ominous incident of
the time was the veiled warning which Cornstalk, the great
Shawanoe chieftain, gave to Captain Thomas Bullitt, head of a
party of royal surveyors, sent out by Lord Dunmore, Governor of
Virginia. Cornstalk at Chillicothe, June 7, 1773, warned Bullitt
concerning the encroachments of the whites, "designed to deprive
us," he said, "of the hunting of 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
the country, <em>as usual</em> &hellip; the
hunting we stand in need of to buy our clothing." During the
preceding summer, George Rogers Clark, an aggressive young
Virginian, with a small party, had descended the Ohio as low as
Fish Creek, where he built a cabin; and in this region for many
months various parties of surveyors were busily engaged in
locating and surveying lands covered by military grants. Most
significant of the ruthless determination of the pioneers to
occupy by force the Kentucky area was the action of the large
party from Monongahela, some forty in number, led by Captain
James Harrod, who penetrated to the present Miller County, where
in June, 1774, they made improvements and actually laid out a
town.
</p>

<p>
A significant, secretly conducted movement, of which historians
have taken but little account, was now in progress under the
manipulation of Virginia's royal governor. As early as 1770 Dr.
John Connolly proposed the establishment of an extensive colony
south of the Ohio; and the design of securing such territory from
the Indians found lodgment in the mind of Lord Dunmore. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
But this
design was for the moment thwarted when on October 28, 1773, an
order was issued from the Privy Council chamber in Whitehall
granting an immense territory, including all of the present West
Virginia and the land alienated to Virginia by Donelson's
agreement with the Cherokees (1772), to a company including
Thomas Walpole, Samuel Wharton, Benjamin Franklin, and others.
This new colony, to be named "Vandalia," seemed assured. A clash
between Dunmore and the royal authorities was imminent; for
Virginia under her sea-to-sea charter claimed the vast middle
region of the continent, extending without known limit to west
and northwest. Moreover, Dunmore was interested in great land
speculations on his own account; and while overtly vindicating
Virginia's claim to the trans-Alleghany by despatching parties of
surveyors to the western wilderness to locate and survey lands
covered by military grants, he with the collusion of certain
members of the "Honourable Board," his council, as charged by
Washington, was 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
more than "lukewarm," secretly restricting as rigorously as he dared 
the extent and number of the soldiers' allotments. According to the 
famous <i>Virginia Remonstrance</i>, he was in league with "men of 
great influence in some of the neighboring states" to secure, under 
cover of purchases from the Indians, large tracts of country between 
the Ohio and the Mississippi. 
<a href="#Note_139"><span class="superscript">[139]</span></a>
In shaping his plans Dunmore had the 
shrewd legal counsel of Patrick Henry, who was equally intent upon 
making for himself a private purchase from the Cherokees. It was 
Henry's legal opinion that the Indiana purchase from the Six Nations 
by the Pennsylvania traders at Fort Stanwix (November 5, 1768) was 
valid; and that purchase by private individuals from the Indians 
gave full and ample title. 
<a href="#Note_140"><span class="superscript">[140]</span></a>
In consequence of these facts, William 
Murray, in behalf of himself and his associates of the Illinois Land
Company, and on the strength of the Camden-Yorke decision,
purchased two large tracts, on the Illinois and Ohio
respectively, from the Illinois Indians (July 5, 1773); and in
order 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
to win the support of Dunmore, who was ambitious to make a
fortune in land speculation, organized a second company, the
Wabash (Ouabache) Land Company, with the governor as the chief
share-holder. In response to Murray's petition on behalf of the
Illinois Land Company, Dunmore (May, 1774) recommended it to Lord
Dartmouth, Secretary of State for the Colonies, and urged that it
be granted; and in a later letter he disingenuously disclaimed
any personal interest in the Illinois speculation.
</p>

<p>
The party of surveyors sent out under the direction of Colonel
William Preston, on the request of Washington and other leading
eastern men, in 1774 located lands covered by military grants on
the Ohio and in the Kentucky area for prominent Virginians,
including Washington, Patrick Henry, William Byrd, William
Preston, Arthur Campbell, William Fleming, and Andrew Lewis,
among others, and also a large tract for Dr. Connolly. Certain of
these grants fell within the Vandalia area; and in his reply
(September 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
10, 1774) to Dunmore's letter, Lord Dartmouth sternly
censured Dunmore for allowing these grants, and accused the white
settlers of having brought on, by such unwarrantable aggressions,
the war then raging with the Indians. This charge lay at the door
of Dunmore himself; and there is strong evidence that Dunmore
personally fomented the war, ostensibly in support of Virginia's
charter rights, but actually in order to further his own
speculative designs. 
<a href="#Note_141"><span class="superscript">[141]</span></a>
Dunmore's agent, Dr. Connolly, heading a
party posing as Virginia militia, fired without provocation upon
a delegation of Shawanoe chiefs assembled at Fort Pitt (January,
1774). Taking advantage of the alarming situation created by the
conflict of the claims of Virginia and Pennsylvania, Connolly,
inspired by Dunmore without doubt, then issued an incendiary
circular (April 21, 1774), declaring a state of war to exist.
Just two weeks before the Battle of the Great Kanawha, Patrick
Henry categorically stated, in conversation with Thomas Wharton:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
that he was at Williamsburg with Ld. D. when Dr. Conolly first
came there, that Conolly is a chatty, sensible man, and informed
Ld. Dunmore of the extreme richness of the lands which lay on
both sides of the Ohio; that the prohibitory orders which had
been sent him relative to the land on the hither side (or
Vandalia) had caused him to turn his thoughts to the opposite
shore, and that as his Lordship was determined to settle his
family in America he was really pursueing this war, in order to
obtain by purchase or treaty from the natives a tract of
territory on that side; he then told me that he was convinced
from every authority that the law knew, that a purchase from the
natives was as full and ample a title as could be obtained, that
they had Lord Camden and Mr. York's opinion on that head, which
opinion with some others that Ld. Dunmore had consulted, and with
the knowledge Conolly had given him of the quality of the country
and his determined resolution to settle his family on this
continent, were the real motives or springs of the present
expedition.
<a href="#Note_142"><span class="superscript">[142]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">
At this very time, Patrick Henry, in conjunction with William
Byrd 3d and others, was negotiating for a private purchase of
lands from the Cherokees; and when Wharton, after 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
answering
Henry's inquiry as to where he might buy Indian goods, remarked:
"It's not possible you mean to enter the Indian trade at this
period," Henry laughingly replied: "The wish-world is my hobby
horse." "From whence I conclude," adds Wharton, "he has some
prospect of making a purchase of the natives, but where I know
not."
</p>

<p>
The war, thus promulgated, we believe, at Dunmore's secret
instigation and heralded by a series of ghastly atrocities, came
on apace. After the inhuman murder of the family of Logan, the
Indian chieftain, by one Greathouse and his drunken companions
(April 30th), Logan, who contrary to romantic views was a
black-hearted and vengeful savage, harried the Tennessee and
Virginia borders, burning and slaughtering. Unable to arouse the
Cherokees, owing to the opposition of Atta-kulla-kulla, Logan as
late as July 21st said in a letter to the whites: "The Indians
are not angry, only myself," and not until then did Dunmore begin
to give full execution to his warlike plans. The best woodsmen of
the border, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Daniel Boone and the German scout Michael Stoner,
having been despatched on July 27th by Colonel William Preston to
warn the surveyors of the trans-Alleghany, made a remarkable
journey on foot of eight hundred miles in sixty-one days.
Harrod's company at Harrodsburg, a company of surveyors at
Fontainebleau, Floyd's party on the Kentucky, and the surveyors
at Mann's Lick, thus warned, hurried in to the settlements and
were saved. Meanwhile, Dunmore, in command of the Virginia
forces, invaded territory guaranteed to the Indians by the royal
proclamation of 1763 and recently (1774) added to the province of
Quebec, a fact of which he was not aware, conducted a vigorous
campaign, and fortified Camp Charlotte, near Old Chillicothe.
Andrew Lewis, however, in charge of the other division of
Dunmore's army, was the one destined to bear the real brunt and
burden of the campaign. His division, recruited from the very
flower of the pioneers of the Old Southwest, was the most
representative body of borderers of this region that up to this
time had assembled 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
to measure strength with the red men. It was
an army of the true stalwarts of the frontier, with fringed
leggings and hunting-capes, rifles and powder-horns,
hunting-knives and tomahawks.
</p>

<p>
The Battle of the Great Kanawha, at Point Pleasant, was fought on
October 10, 1774, between Lewis's force, eleven hundred strong,
and the Indians, under Cornstalk, somewhat inferior in numbers.
It was a desultory action, over a greatly extended front and in
very brushy country between Crooked Creek and the Ohio.
Throughout the long day, the Indians fought with rare craft and
stubborn bravery&mdash;loudly cursing the white men, cleverly picking
off their leaders, and derisively inquiring, in regard to the
absence of the fifes: "Where are your whistles now?" Slowly
retreating, they sought to draw the whites into an ambuscade and
at a favorable moment to "drive the Long Knives like bullocks
into the river." No marked success was achieved on either side
until near sunset, when a flank movement directed by young Isaac
Shelby 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
alarmed the Indians, who mistook this party for the
expected reinforcement under Christian, and retired across the
Ohio. In the morning the whites were amazed to discover that the
Indians, who the preceding day so splendidly heeded the echoing
call of Cornstalk, "Be strong! Be strong!", had quit the
battle-field and left the victory with the whites.
<a href="#Note_143"><span class="superscript">[143]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The peace negotiated by Dunmore was durable. The governor had
accomplished his purpose, defied the authority of the crown, and
vindicated the claim of Virginia, to the enthusiastic
satisfaction of the backwoodsmen. While tendering their thanks to
him and avowing their allegiance to George III, at the close of
the campaign, the borderers proclaimed their resolution to exert
all their powers "for the defense of American liberty, and for
the support of her just rights and privileges, not in any
precipitous, riotous or tumultuous manner, but when regularly
called forth by the unanimous voice of our countrymen." Dunmore's
War is epochal, in that it procured for 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
the nonce a state of
peace with the Indians, which made possible the advance of Judge
Henderson over the Transylvania Trail in 1775, and, through his
establishment of the Transylvania Fort at Boonesborough, the
ultimate acquisition by the American Confederation of the
imperial domain of the trans-Alleghany.

   Richard Henderson and the Transylvania Company
</p>
<p class="intro">
I happened to fall in company, and have a great deal of
conversation with one of the most singular and extraordinary
persons and excentric geniuses in America, and perhaps in the
world. His name is Richard Henderson.

<span class="dropcap">E</span><span class="smcap">arly</span> 
in 1774, chastened by his own 
disastrous failure the preceding autumn, Boone advised Judge 
Henderson that the time was auspicious for opening negotiations 
with the Cherokees for purchasing the trans-Alleghany region.
<a href="#Note_145"><span class="superscript">[145]</span></a> 
In organizing a company for this purpose, Henderson chose men 
of action and resource, leaders in the colony, ready for any 
hazard of life and fortune in this gigantic scheme of 
colonization and promotion. The new men included, in addition 
to the partners in the organization known as Richard Henderson 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and Company, were Colonel John Luttrell, destined to win laurels 
in the Revolution, and William Johnston, a native of Scotland, 
the leading merchant of Hillsborough.
<a href="#Note_146"><span class="superscript">[146]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_217_2" id="Page_217_2"></a>
Meeting in Hillsborough on August 27, 1774, these men organized
the new company under the name of the Louisa Company. In the
articles then drawn up they agreed to "rent or purchase" a tract
of land from the Indian owners of the soil for the express
purpose of "settling the country." Each partner obligated himself
to "furnish his Quota of Expenses necessary towards procuring the
grant." In full anticipation of the grave dangers to be
encountered, they solemnly bound themselves, as "equal sharers in
the property," to "support each other with our lives and
fortunes." 
<a href="#Note_147"><span class="superscript">[147]</span></a>
Negotiations with the Indians were begun at once.
Accompanied by Colonel Nathaniel Hart and guided by the
experienced Indian-trader, Thomas Price, Judge Henderson visited
the Cherokee chieftains at the Otari towns. After elaborate
consultations, the latter deputed the old chieftain,
Atta-kulla-kulla, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
a young buck, and a squaw, "to attend the said
Henderson and Hart to North Carolina, and there examine the Goods
and Merchandize which had been by them offered as the
Consideration of the purchase." The goods purchased at Cross
Creek (now Fayetteville, North Carolina), in which the Louisa
Company "had embarked a large amount," met the entire approval of
the Indians&mdash;the squaw in particular shrewdly examining the goods
in the interest of the women of the tribe.
<a href="#Note_148"><span class="superscript">[148]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_218_2" id="Page_218_2"></a>
On January 6, 1775, the company was again enlarged, and given the
name of the Transylvania Company&mdash;the three new partners being
David Hart, brother to Thomas and Nathaniel, Leonard Henley
Bullock, a prominent citizen of Granville, and James Hogg, of
Hillsborough, a native Scotchman and one of the most influential
men in the colony. In the elaborate agreement drawn up reference
is explicitly made to the contingency of "settling and voting as
a proprietor and giving Rules and Regulations for the Inhabitants
etc." 
<a href="#Note_149"><span class="superscript">[149]</span></a>
Hillsborough was the actual starting-point for 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
the westward movement, the first emigrants traveling thence to the 
Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga. In speaking of the departure of the
settlers, the first movement of extended and permanent westward
migration, an eye-witness quaintly says: "At this place
[Hillsborough] I saw the first party of emigrant families that
moved to Kentucky under the auspices of Judge Henderson. They
marched out of the town with considerable solemnity, and to many
their destination seemed as remote as if it had been to the South
Sea Islands." 
<a href="#Note_150"><span class="superscript">[150]</span></a>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the "Proposals for the encouragement of
settling the lands etc.," issued on Christmas Day, 1774, were
quickly spread broadcast through the colony and along the
border. 
<a href="#Note_151"><span class="superscript">[151]</span></a>
It was the greatest sensation North Carolina had known
since Alamance; and Archibald Neilson, deputy-auditor and naval
officer of the colony, inquired with quizzical anxiety: "Pray, is
Dick Henderson out of his head?" The most liberal terms,
proffered by one quite in possession of his head, were embodied
in these proposals. Land at twenty 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
shillings per hundred acres
was offered to each emigrant settling within the territory and
raising a crop of corn before September 1, 1775, the emigrant
being permitted to take up as much as five hundred acres for 
himself and two hundred and fifty acres for each tithable person
under him. In these "Proposals" there was no indication that the
low terms at which the lands were offered would be maintained
after September 1, 1775. 
<a href="#Note_152"><span class="superscript">[152]</span></a>
In a letter to Governor Dunmore
(January, 1775), Colonel William Preston, county surveyor of
Fincastle County, Virginia, says: "The low price he [Henderson]
proposes to sell at, together with some further encouragement he
offers, will I am apprehensive induce a great many families to
remove from this County (Fincastle) &amp; Carolina and settle there."
<a href="#Note_153"><span class="superscript">[153]</span></a>
Joseph Martin, states his son, "was appointed entry-Taker and
agent for the Powell Valley portion" of the Transylvania Purchase
on January 20, 1775; and "he (Joseph Martin) and others went on
in the early part of the year 1775 and made their stand at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
very spot where he had made corn several years before." 
<a href="#Note_154"><span class="superscript">[154]</span></a>
In speaking of the startling design, unmasked by Henderson, of
establishing an independent government, Colonel Preston writes to
George Washington of the contemplated "large Purchase by one 
Col.<span class="superscript">o</span> Henderson of North Carolina 
from the Cherokees.&hellip; I hear
that Henderson talks with great Freedom &amp; Indecency of the
Governor of Virginia, sets the Government at Defiance &amp; says if
he once had five hundred good Fellows settled in that Country he
would not Value Virginia."
<a href="#Note_155"><span class="superscript">[155]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Early in 1775 runners were sent off to the Cherokee towns to
summon the Indians to the treaty ground at the Sycamore Shoals of
the Watauga; and Boone, after his return from a hunt in Kentucky
in January, was summoned by Judge Henderson to aid in the
negotiations preliminary to the actual treaty. The dominating
figure in the remarkable assemblage at the treaty ground,
consisting of twelve hundred Indians and several hundred whites,
was Richard Henderson, "comely in 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
person, of a benign and social
disposition," with countenance betokening the man of strenuous
action&mdash;"noble forehead, prominent nose, projecting chin, 
firm-set jaw, with kindness and openness of expression." Gathered about
him, picturesque in garb and striking in appearance, were many of
the buckskin-clad leaders of the border&mdash;James Robertson, John
Sevier, Isaac Shelby, William Bailey Smith, and their
compeers&mdash;as well as his Carolina friends John Williams, Thomas
and Nathaniel Hart, Nathaniel Henderson, Jesse Benton, 
<a href="#Note_156"><span class="superscript">[156]</span></a>
and Valentine Searcy.
</p>

<p>
Little was accomplished on the first day of the treaty (March
14th); but on the next day, the Cherokees offered to sell the
section bargained for by Donelson acting as agent for Virginia in
1771. Although the Indians pointed out that Virginia had never
paid the promised compensation of five hundred pounds and had
therefore forfeited her rights, Henderson flatly refused to
entertain the idea of purchasing territory to which Virginia had
the prior claim. Angered by Henderson's refusal, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
The Dragging Canoe, leaping into the circle of the seated savages, 
made an impassioned speech touched with the romantic imagination 
peculiar to the American Indian. With pathetic eloquence he dwelt 
upon the insatiable land-greed of the white men, and predicted the
extinction of his race if they committed the insensate folly of
selling their beloved hunting-grounds. Roused to a high pitch of
oratorical fervor, the savage with uplifted arm fiercely exhorted
his people to resist further encroachments at all hazards&mdash;and
left the treaty ground. This incident brought the conference to a
startling and abrupt conclusion. On the following day, however,
the savages proved more tractable, agreeing to sell the land as
far south as the Cumberland River. In order to secure the additional
territory watered by the tributaries of the Cumberland, Henderson
agreed to pay an additional sum of two thousand pounds. Upon this
day there originated the ominous phrase descriptive of Kentucky
when The Dragging Canoe, dramatically pointing toward the west,
declared that a <em>Dark</em> Cloud 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
hung over that land, which was known as the <em>Bloody Ground</em>.
</p>

<p>
On the last day, March 17th, the negotiations were opened with
the signing of the "Great Grant." The area purchased, some twenty
millions of acres, included almost all the present state of
Kentucky, and an immense tract in Tennessee, comprising all the
territory watered by the Cumberland River and all its
tributaries. For "two thousand weight of leather in goods"
Henderson purchased "the lands lying down Holston and between the
Watauga lease, Colonel Donelson's line and Powell's Mountain" as
a pathway to Kentucky&mdash;the deed for which was known as the "Path
Deed." By special arrangement, Carter's Valley in this tract went
to Carter and Lucas; two days later, for two thousand pounds,
Charles Robertson on behalf of the Watauga Association purchased
a large tract in the valleys of the Holston, Watauga, and New
Rivers; and eight days later Jacob Brown purchased two large
areas, including the Nolichucky Valley. This historic 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
treaty,
which heralds the opening of the West, was conducted with
absolute justice and fairness by Judge Henderson and his
associates. No liquor was permitted at the treaty ground; and
Thomas Price, the ablest of the Cherokee traders, deposed that
"he at that time understood the Cherokee language, so as to
comprehend everything which was said and to know that what was
observed on either side was fairly and truly translated; that the
Cherokees perfectly understood, what Lands were the subject of
the Treaty.&hellip;" The amount paid by the Transylvania Company
for the imperial domain was ten thousand pounds sterling, in
money and in goods.
<a href="#Note_157"><span class="superscript">[157]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Although Daniel Boone doubtless assisted in the proceedings prior
to the negotiation of the treaty, his name nowhere appears in the
voluminous records of the conference. Indeed, he was not then
present; for a fortnight before the conclusion of the treaty he
was commissioned by Judge Henderson to form a party of competent
woodmen to blaze a passage through the wilderness. On March 10th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
this party of thirty ax-men, under the leadership of Boone,
started from the rendezvous, the Long Island of Holston, to
engage in the arduous labor of cutting out the Transylvania
Trail.
<a href="#Note_158"><span class="superscript">[158]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_226_2" id="Page_226_2"></a>
Henderson, the empire-builder, now faced with courage and
resolution the hazardous task of occupying the purchased
territory and establishing an independent government. No mere
financial promoter of a vast speculative enterprise, he was one
of the heroic figures of the Old Southwest; and it was his
dauntless courage, his unwavering resolve to go forward in the
face of all dangers, which carried through the armed "trek" to a
successful conclusion. At Martin's Station, where Henderson and
his party tarried to build a house in which to store their
wagons, as the road could be cleared no further, they were joined
by another party, of five adventurers from Prince William County,
Virginia. 
<a href="#Note_159"><span class="superscript">[159]</span></a>
In Henderson's party were some forty men and boys,
with forty pack-horses and a small amount of powder, lead, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
salt,
and garden-seeds. The warning freely given by Joseph Martin of
the perils of the path was soon confirmed, as appears from the
following entry in Henderson's diary:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Page_227_2" id="Page_227_2"></a>
<i>Friday the 7th</i>. [April] About Brake of Day began to snow. About
11 oClock received a letter from Mr. Luttrells camp that were
five persons kill<span class="superscript">d</span>. on the road to the 
Cantuckie by Indians. Cap<span class="superscript">t</span>. [Nathaniel] Hart, 
uppon the receipt of this News Retreated back with his Company, &amp; 
determined to Settle in the Valley to make Corn for the Cantucky people. 
The same Day Received a Letter from Da<span class="superscript">n</span>.

&amp;<span class="superscript">c</span>.
<a href="#Note_160"><span class="superscript">[160]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The following historic letter, which reveals alike the dogged
resolution of Boone and his reliance upon Henderson and his
company in this black hour of disaster, addressed "Colonel
Richard Henderson&mdash;these with care," is eloquent in its
simplicity:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="letter" style="text-indent:0;">
<span class="smcap">Dear Colonel</span>: 
After my compliments to you, I shall acquaint you
of our misfortunes. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
On March the 25 a party of Indians fired on
my Company about half an hour before day, and killed Mr. Twitty
and his negro, and wounded Mr. Walker very deeply, but I hope he
will recover.
</p>

<p class="letter">
On March the 28 as we were hunting for provisions, we found
Samuel Tate's son, who gave us an account that the Indians fired
on their camp on the 27th day. My brother and I went down and
found two men killed and sculped, Thomas McDowell and Jeremiah
McFeters. I have sent a man down to all the lower companies in
order to gather them all at the mouth of Otter Creek.
</p>

<p class="letter">
My advice to you, Sir, is to come or send as soon as possible.
Your company is desired greatly, for the people are very uneasy,
but are willing to stay and venture their lives with you. and now
is the time to flusterate their [the Indians'] intentions, and
keep the country, whilst we are in it. If we give way to them
now, it will ever be the case. This day we start from the battle
ground, for the mouth of Otter Creek, where we shall immediately
erect a Fort, which will be done before you can come or send,
then we can send ten men to meet you, if you send for them.
</p>

<p class="letter" style="margin-bottom:0;">
I am, Sir, your most obedient</p>
<p class="letter-center">
          Omble Sarvent</p>
<p class="letter-right">

</p>

<p class="letter" style="text-indent:0;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
N.B. We stood on the ground and guarded our baggage till day,
and lost nothing. We have about fifteen miles to Cantuck
[Kentucky River] at Otter Creek.
<a href="#Note_161"><span class="superscript">[161]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<p class="noindent">
This dread intelligence caused the hearts of strong men to quail
and induced some to turn back, but Henderson, the jurist-pioneer,
was made of sterner stuff. At once (April 8th) he despatched an
urgent letter in hot haste to the proprietors of Transylvania,
enclosing Boone's letter, informing them of Boone's plight and
urging them to send him immediately a large quantity of powder
and lead, as he had been compelled to abandon his supply of
saltpeter at Martin's Station. "We are all in high spirits," he
assures the proprietors, "and on thorns to fly to Boone's
assistance, and join him in defense of so fine and valuable a
country."  Laconically eloquent is this simple entry in his diary: 
"Saturday the 8th. Started ab<span class="superscript">t</span>. 
10 <span class="superscript">o</span>Clock Crossed Cumberland Gap 
about 4 miles met about 40 persons Returning from the Cantucky, on 
Acc<span class="superscript">t</span>. of the Late Murders by the 
Indians could prevail on one only to 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
return. 
Mem<span class="superscript">o</span> Several Virginians who were 
with us return'd."
</p>

<p>
There is no more crucial moment in early Western history than
this, in which we see the towering form of Henderson, clad in the
picturesque garb of the pioneer, with outstretched arm resolutely
pointing forward to the "dark and bloody ground," and in
impassioned but futile eloquence pleading with the pale and
panic-stricken fugitives to turn about, to join his company, and
to face once more the mortal dangers of pioneer conquest.
Significant indeed are the lines:
</p>

<div class="poem1">
    <p class="poem1">Some to endure, and many to fail,</p>
    <p class="poem1">Some to conquer, and many to quail,</p>
    <p class="poem1">Toiling over the Wilderness Trail.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
The spirit of the pioneer knight-errant inspires Henderson's
words: "In this situation, some few, of genuine courage and
undaunted resolution, served to inspire the rest; by the help of
whose example, assisted by a little pride and some ostentation,
we made a shift to march on with all the appearance of gallantry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
and, cavalier like, treated every insinuation of danger with the
utmost contempt."
</p>

<p>
Fearing that Boone, who did not even know that Henderson's
cavalcade was on the road, would be unable to hold out, Henderson
realized the imperative necessity for sending him a message of
encouragement. The bold young Virginian, William Cocke,
volunteered to brave alone the dangers of the murder-haunted
trail&mdash;to undertake a ride more truly memorable and hazardous than
that of Revere. "This offer, extraordinary as it was, we could by
no means refuse," remarks Henderson, who shed tears of gratitude
as he proffered his sincere thanks and wrung the brave
messenger's hand. Equipped with "a good Queen Anne's musket,
plenty of ammunition, a tomahawk, a large cuttoe knife [French,
<i>couteau</i>], a Dutch blanket, and no small quantity of jerked beef,"
Cocke on April 10th rode off "to the Cantuckey to Inform 
Cap<span class="superscript">t</span> Boone that we were on the road." 
The fearful apprehensions felt for Cocke's safety were later relieved, 
when along the road were discovered his letters informing 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Henderson of his arrival and of
his having been joined on the way by Page Portwood of Rowan. On
his arrival at Otter Creek, Cocke found Boone and his men, and on
relating his adventures, "came in for his share of applause."
Boone at once despatched the master woodman, Michael Stoner, with
pack-horses to assist Henderson's party, which he met on April
18th at their encampment "in the Eye of the Rich Land." Along
with "Excellent Beef in plenty," Stoner brought the story of
Boone's determined stand and an account of the erection of a rude
little fortification which they had hurriedly thrown up to resist
attack. With laconic significance Henderson pays the following
tribute to Boone which deserves to be perpetuated in national
annals: "It was owing to Boone's confidence in us, and the
people's in him, that a stand was ever attempted in order to wait
for our coming."
</p>

<p>
In the course of their journey over the mountains and through the
wilderness, the pioneers forgot the trials of the trail in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
face of the surpassing beauties of the country. The Cumberlands
were covered with rich undergrowth of the red and white
rhododendron, the delicate laurel, the mountain ivy, the
flame-azalea, the spicewood, and the cane; while the white stars
of the dogwood and the carmine blossoms of the red-bud, strewn
across the verdant background of the forest, gleamed in the eager
air of spring. "To enter uppon a detail of the Beuty &amp; Goodness
of our Country," writes Nathaniel Henderson, "would be a task too
arduous.&hellip; Let it suffice to tell you it far exceeds any
country I ever saw or herd off. I am conscious its out of the
power of any man to make you clearly sensible of the great Beuty
and Richness of Kentucky." Young Felix Walker, endowed with more
vivid powers of description, says with a touch of native
eloquence:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps no Adventureor Since the days of donquicksotte or before
ever felt So Cheerful &amp; Ilated in prospect, every heart abounded
with Joy &amp; excitement &hellip; &amp; exclusive of the Novelties of the
Journey the advantages &amp; 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
accumalations arising on the Settlement
of a new Country was a dazzling object with many of our Company.&hellip;
As the Cain ceased, we began to discover the pleasing &amp;
Rapturous appearance of the plains of Kentucky, a New Sky &amp;
Strange Earth to be presented to our view.&hellip; So Rich a Soil
we had never Saw before, Covered with Clover in full Bloom. the
Woods alive abounding in wild Game, turkeys so numerous that it
might be said there appeared but one flock Universally Scattered
in the woods &hellip; it appeared that Nature in the profusion of
her Bounties, had Spread a feast for all that lives, both for the
Animal &amp; Rational World, a Sight so delightful to our View and
grateful to our feelings almost Induced us, in Immitation of
Columbus in Transport to Kiss the Soil of Kentucky, as he haild &amp;
Saluted the sand on his first setting his foot on the Shores of
America.
<a href="#Note_162"><span class="superscript">[162]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the journey Henderson was joined in Powell's Valley by
Benjamin Logan, afterward so famous in Kentucky annals, and a
companion, William Galaspy. At the Crab Orchard they left
Henderson's party; and turning their course westward finally
pitched camp in the present Lincoln County, where 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Logan
subsequently built a fort. On Sunday, April 16th, on Scaggs's
Creek, Henderson records: "About 12 oClock Met James McAfee with
18 other persons Returning from Cantucky." They advised Henderson
of the "troublesomeness and danger" of the Indians, says Robert
McAfee junior: "but Henderson assured them that he had purchased
the whole country from the Indians, that it belonged to him, and
he had named it Transylvania.&hellip; Robt, Samuel, and William
McAfee and 3 others were inclined to return, but James opposed
it, alleging that Henderson had no right to the land, and that
Virginia had previously bought it. The former (6) returned with
Henderson to Boonesborough." Among those who had joined
Henderson's party was Abraham Hanks from Virginia, the maternal
grandfather of Abraham Lincoln; but alarmed by the stories
brought by Stewart and his party of fugitives, Hanks and Drake,
as recorded by William Calk on that day (April 13th), turned
back.
<a href="#Note_163"><span class="superscript">[163]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
At last the founder of Kentucky with his 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
little band reached the
destined goal of their arduous journeyings. Henderson's record on
his birthday runs: "Thursday the 20th [April] Arrived at Fort
Boone on the Mouth of Oter Creek Cantuckey River where we were
Saluted by a running fire of about 25 Guns; all that was then at
Fort.&hellip; The men appeared in high spirits &amp; much rejoiced in
our arrival." It is a coincidence of historic interest that just
one day after the embattled farmers at Lexington and Concord
"fired the shots heard round the world," the echoing shots of
Boone and his sturdy backwoodsmen rang out to announce the
arrival of the proprietor of Transylvania and the birth of the
American West.

&mdash;<span class="smcap">Judge Richard Henderson</span>:
Address to the Legislature of Transylvania, May 23, 1775.
</p>

<br>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> 
independent spirit displayed by 
the Transylvania Company, and Henderson's procedure in open 
defiance of the royal governors of both North Carolina and 
Virginia, naturally aroused grave alarm throughout these 
colonies and South Carolina. "This in my Opinion," says 
Preston in a letter to George Washington (January 31, 1775), 
"will soon become a serious Affair, &amp; highly 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
deserves the Attention of the Government. For it is certain that a vast
Number of People are preparing to go out and settle on this
Purchase; and if once they get fixed there, it will be next to
impossible to remove them or reduce them to Obedience; as they
are so far from the Seat of Government. Indeed it may be the
Cherokees will support them." 
<a href="#Note_164"><span class="superscript">[164]</span></a>
Governor Martin of North Carolina,
already deeply disturbed in anticipation of the coming
revolutionary cataclysm, thundered in what was generally regarded
as a forcible-feeble proclamation (February 19, 1775) against
"Richard Henderson and his Confederates" in their "daring, unjust
and unwarrantable proceedings." 
<a href="#Note_165"><span class="superscript">[165]</span></a>
In a letter to Dartmouth he
denounces "Henderson the famous invader" and dubs the
Transylvania Company "an infamous Company of land Pyrates."
</p>

<p>
Officials who were themselves eager for land naturally opposed
Henderson's plans. Lord Dunmore, who in 1774, as we have seen,
was heavily interested in the Wabash Land Company engineered by
William Murray, took the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
ground that the Wabash purchase was valid under the Camden-Yorke 
decision. This is so stated in the records of the Illinois Company,
likewise under Murray's control. But although the "Ouabache Company," 
of which Dunmore was a leading member, was initiated as early as 
May 16, 1774, the purchase of the territory was not formally 
effected until October 18, 1775&mdash;too late to benefit Dunmore, 
then deeply embroiled in the preliminaries to the Revolution. Under 
the cover of his agent's name, it is believed, Dunmore, with his 
"passion for land and fees," illegally entered tracts aggregating 
thousands of acres of land surveyed by the royal surveyors in the 
summer of 1774 for Dr. John Connolly. 
<a href="#Note_166"><span class="superscript">[166]</span></a>
Early in this same year, Patrick
Henry, who, as already pointed out, had entered large tracts in
Kentucky in violation of Virginia's treaty obligations with the
Cherokees, united with William Byrd 3d, John Page, Ralph Wormley,
Samuel Overton, and William Christian, in the effort to purchase
from the Cherokees a tract of land west of Donelson's line, being
firmly persuaded 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
of the validity of the Camden-Yorke opinion.
Their agent, William Kenedy, considerably later in the year, went
on a mission to the Cherokee towns, and upon his return reported
that the Indians might be induced to sell. When it became known
that Judge Henderson had organized the Transylvania Company and
anticipated Patrick Henry and his associates, Colonel Arthur
Campbell, as he himself states, applied to several of the
partners of the Transylvania Company on behalf of Patrick Henry,
requesting that Henry be taken in as a partner. 
<a href="#Note_167"><span class="superscript">[167]</span></a>
It was afterward stated, as commonly understood among the 
Transylvania proprietors, that both Patrick Henry and Thomas 
Jefferson desired to become members of the company; but that 
Colonel Richard Henderson was instrumental in preventing their 
admission "lest they should supplant the Colonel [Henderson] 
as the guiding spirit of the company."
<a href="#Note_168"><span class="superscript">[168]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Fully informed by Preston's elaborate communication on the
gravity of the situation, Dunmore acted energetically, though
tardily, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
to prevent the execution of Henderson's designs. On
March 21st Dunmore sent flying through the back country a
proclamation, demanding the immediate relinquishment of the
territory by "one Richard Henderson and other disorderly persons,
his associates," and "in case of refusal, and of violently
detaining such possession, that he or they be immediately fined
and imprisoned." 
<a href="#Note_169"><span class="superscript">[169]</span></a>
This proclamation, says a peppery old chronicler,
may well rank with the one excepting those arch traitors and
rebels, Samuel Adams and John Hancock, from the mercy of the
British monarch. In view of Dunmore's confidence in the validity
of the Camden-Yorke decision, it is noteworthy that no mention of
the royal proclamation of 1763 occurs in his broadside; and that
he bases his objection to the Transylvania purchase upon the
king's instructions that all vacant lands "within this colony" be
laid off in tracts, from one hundred to one thousand acres in
extent, and sold at public auction. This proclamation which was
enclosed, oddly enough, in a letter of official instructions 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
to Preston warning him not to survey any lands "beyond the line run
by Colonel Donaldson," proved utterly ineffective. At the same
time, Dunmore despatched a pointed letter to Oconostota,
Atta-kulla-kulla, Judge's Friend, and other Cherokee chieftains,
notifying them that the sale of the great tract of land below the
Kentucky was illegal and threatening them with the king's
displeasure if they did not repudiate the sale.
<a href="#Note_170"><span class="superscript">[170]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
News of the plans which Henderson had already matured for
establishing an independent colony in the trans-Alleghany
wilderness, now ran like wild-fire through Virginia. In a letter
to George Washington (April 9, 1775), Preston ruefully says:
"Henderson I hear has made the Purchase &amp; got a Conveyance of the
great and Valluable Country below the Kentucky from the
Cherokees. He and about 300 adventurers are gone out to take
Possession, who it is said intends to set up an independent
Government &amp; form a Code of Laws for themselves. How this may be
I cant say, but I am affraid the steps taken by 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
the Government have been too late. Before the Purchase was made had 
the Governor interfered it is believed the Indians would not have sold."
<a href="#Note_171"><span class="superscript">[171]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Judge Henderson, with strenuous energy, had begun to
erect a large stockaded fort according to plans of his own.
Captain James Harrod with forty-two men was stationed at the
settlement he had made the preceding year, having arrived there
before the McAfees started back to Virginia; and there were small
groups of settlers at Boiling Spring, six miles southeast of
Harrod's settlement, and at St. Asaph's, a mile west of the
present Stanford. A representative government for Transylvania
was then planned. When the frank and gallant Floyd arrived at the
Transylvania Fort on May 3d, he "expressed great satisfaction,"
says Judge Henderson, "on being informed of the plan we proposed
for Legislation &amp; sayd he must most heartily concur in that &amp;
every other measure we should adopt for the well 
Govern<span class="superscript">g</span> or good of the Community 
in Gen<span class="superscript">l</span>." In reference to a 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
conversation with Captain James Harrod and Colonel Thomas Slaughter 
of Virginia, Henderson notes in his diary (May 8th): "Our plan of 
Legislation, the evils pointed out&mdash;the remedies to be applyed 
&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c were Acceeded to without Hesitation. The plann 
was plain &amp; Simple&mdash;'twas
nothing novel in its essence a thousand years ago it was
in use, and found by every year's experience since to be
unexceptionable. We were in four distinct 
settlem<span class="superscript">ts</span>. Members or
delegates from every place by free choice of Individuals they
first having entered into writings solemnly binding themselves to
obey and carry into Execution Such Laws as representatives should
from time to time make, Concurred with, by A Majority of the
Proprietors present in the Country."
</p>

<p>
In reply to inquiries of the settlers, Judge Henderson gave as
his reason for this assembling of a Transylvania Legislature that
"all power was derived from the people." Six days before the
prophetic arrival of the news of the Battle of Lexington and
eight days before 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the revolutionary committee of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, 
promulgated their memorable Resolves establishing laws for an 
independent government, the pioneers assembled on the green beneath 
the mighty plane-tree at the Transylvania Fort. In his wise and 
statesmanlike address to this picturesque convention of free 
Americans (May 23, 1775), an address which Felix Walker described 
as being "considered equal to any of like kind ever delivered to 
any deliberate body in that day and time," Judge Henderson used 
these memorable words:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
You, perhaps, are fixing the palladium, or placing the first
corner stone of an edifice, the height and magnificence of whose
superstructure &hellip; can only become great in proportion to the
excellence of its foundation.&hellip; If any doubt remain amongst
you with respect to the force or efficiency of whatever laws you
now, or hereafter make, be pleased to consider that <em>all power is
originally in the people; make it their interest, therefore, by
impartial and beneficent laws, and you may be sure of their
inclination to see them enforced.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
An early writer, in speaking of the full-blooded democracy of
these "advanced" sentiments, quaintly comments: "If Jeremy
Bentham had been in existence of manhood, he would have sent his
compliments to the President of Transylvania." This, the first
representative body of American freemen which ever convened west
of the Alleghanies, is surely the most unique colonial government
ever set up on this continent. The proceedings of this backwoods
legislature&mdash;the democratic leadership of the principal
proprietor; the prudence exhibited in the laws for protecting
game, breeding horses, etc.; the tolerance shown in the granting
of full religious liberty&mdash;all display the acumen and practical
wisdom of these pioneer law-givers. As the result of Henderson's
tactfulness, the proprietary form of government, thoroughly
democratized in tone, was complacently accepted by the 
backwoodsmen. From one who, though still under royal rule, vehemently
asserted that the source of all political power was the people,
and that "laws 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
derive force and efficiency from our mutual
consent," Western democracy thus born in the wilderness was
"taking its first political lesson." In their answer to
Henderson's assertion of freedom from alien authority the
pioneers unhesitatingly declared: "That we have an absolute
right, as a political body, without giving umbrage to Great
Britain, or any of the colonies, to form rules for the government
of our little society, cannot be doubted by any sensible mind and
being without the jurisdiction of, and not answerable to any of
his Majesty's courts, the constituting tribunals of justice shall
be a matter of our first contemplation.&hellip;" In the
establishment of a constitution for the new colony, Henderson
with paternalistic wisdom induced the people to adopt a legal
code based on the laws of England. Out of a sense of
self-protection he reserved for the proprietors only one
prerogative not granted them by the people, the right of veto. He
clearly realized that if this power were given up, the delegates
to any convention 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
that might be held after the first would be able to assume 
the claims and rights of the proprietors.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_248_2" id="Page_248_2"></a>
A land-office was formally opened, deeds were issued, and a store
was established which supplied the colonists with powder, lead,
salt, osnaburgs, blankets, and other chief necessities of pioneer
existence. Writing to his brother Jonathan from Leestown, the
bold young George Rogers Clark, soon to plot the downfall of
Transylvania, enthusiastically says (July 6, 1775): "A richer and
more Beautifull Cuntry than this I believe has never been seen in
America yet. Co<span class="superscript">l</span>. Henderson is 
hear and Claims all y<span class="superscript">e</span> Country
below Kentucke. If his Claim Should be good, land may be got
Reasonable Enough and as good as any in 
y<span class="superscript">e</span> World." 
<a href="#Note_172"><span class="superscript">[172]</span></a>
Those who settled on the south side of Kentucky River acknowledged 
the validity of the Transylvania purchase; and Clark in his 
<i>Memoir</i> says: "the Proprietors at first took great pains 
to Ingratiate themselves in the 
fav<span class="superscript">r</span>. of the people."
</p>

<p>
In regard to the designs of Lord Dunmore, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
who, as noted above,
had illegally entered the Connolly grant on the Ohio and sought
to outlaw Henderson, and of Colonel William Byrd 3d, who, after
being balked in Patrick Henry's plan to anticipate the
Transylvania Company in effecting a purchase from the Cherokees,
was supposed to have tried to persuade the Cherokees to repudiate
the "Great Treaty," Henderson defiantly says: "Whether Lord
Dunmore and Colonel Byrd have interfered with the Indians or not,
Richard Henderson is equally ignorant and indifferent. The utmost
result of their efforts can only serve to convince them of the
futility of their schemes and possibly frighten some few
faint-hearted persons, naturally prone to reverence great names
and fancy everything must shrink at the magic of a splendid
title."
<a href="#Note_173"><span class="superscript">[173]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Prompted by Henderson's desire to petition the Continental
Congress then in session for recognition as the fourteenth
colony, the Transylvania legislature met again on the first
Thursday in September and elected Richard Henderson and John
Williams, among others, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
as delegates to the gathering at Philadelphia. 
<a href="#Note_174"><span class="superscript">[174]</span></a>
Shortly afterward the Proprietors of Transylvania
held a meeting at Oxford, North Carolina (September 25, 1775),
elected Williams as the agent of the colony, and directed him to
proceed to Boonesborough there to reside until April, 1776. James
Hogg, of Hillsborough, chosen as Delegate to represent the Colony
in the Continental Congress, was despatched to Philadelphia,
bearing with him an elaborate memorial prepared by the President,
Judge Henderson, petitioning the Congress "to take the infant
Colony of Transylvania into their protection."
<a href="#Note_175"><span class="superscript">[175]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Almost immediately upon his arrival in Philadelphia, James Hogg
was presented to "the famous Samuel and John Adams." The latter
warned Hogg, in view of the efforts then making toward
reconciliation between the colonies and the king, that "the
taking under our protection a body of people who have acted in
defiance of the King's proclamation, will be looked on as a
confirmation of that independent spirit with which we are daily
reproached." 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Jefferson said that if his advice were followed, all
the use the Virginians should make of their charter would be "to
prevent any arbitrary or oppressive government to be established
within the boundaries of it"; and that it was his wish "to see a
free government established at the back of theirs [Virginia's]
properly united with them." He would not consent, however, that
Congress should acknowledge the colony of Transylvania, until it
had the approbation of the Virginia Convention. The quit-rents
imposed by the company were denounced in Congress as a mark of
vassalage; and many advised a law against the employment of
negroes in the colony. "They even threatened us with their
opposition," says Hogg, with precise veracity, "if we do not act
upon liberal principles when we have it so much in our power to
render ourselves immortal."

</h2>
<p class="chaptertitle">
   The Repulse of the Red Men
</p>
<p class="intro">
To this short war may be properly attributed all the kind
feelings and fidelity to treaty stipulations manifested by the
Cherokees ever afterwards. General Rutherford instilled into the
Indians so great a fear of the whites, that never afterwards were
they disposed to engage in any cruelty, or destroy any of the
property of our frontier men.

<br>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">uring</span> 
the summer of 1775 the proprietors 
of Transylvania were confronted with two stupendous tasks&mdash;that 
of winning the favor and support of the frontiersmen and that of 
rallying the rapidly dwindling forces in Kentucky in defense of the 
settlements. Recognizing the difficulty of including Martin's Station, 
because of its remoteness, with the government provided for Transylvania,
Judge Henderson prepared a plan of government for the group of
settlers located in Powell's Valley. In a letter to Martin (July
30th), in regard to the recent energetic 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
defense of the settlers
at that point against the Indians, Henderson says: "Your spirited
conduct gives me much pleasure.&hellip; Keep your men in heart if
possible, <em>now is our time, the Indians must not drive us</em>." The
gloom which had been occasioned by the almost complete desertion
of the stations at Harrodsburg, the Boiling Spring, and the
Transylvania Fort or Boonesborough was dispelled with the return
of Boone, accompanied by some thirty persons, on September 8th,
and of Richard Callaway with a considerable party on September
26th. The crisis was now passed; and the colony began for the
first time really to flourish. The people on the south side of
the Kentucky River universally accepted proprietary rule for the
time being. But the seeds of dissension were soon to be sown
among those who settled north of the river, as well as among men
of the stamp of James Harrod, who, having preceded Henderson in
the establishment of a settlement in Kentucky, naturally resented
holding lands under the Transylvania Company.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
The great liberality of this organization toward incoming
settlers had resulted in immense quantities of land being taken
up through their land-office. 
<a href="#Note_177"><span class="superscript">[177]</span></a>
The ranging, hunting, and road-building were paid for by the company; 
and the entire settlement was furnished with powder, lead, and 
supplies, wholly on credit, for this and the succeeding year. 
"Five hundred and sixty thousand acres of land are now entered," 
reports Floyd on December 1st, "and most of the people waiting to 
have it run out." 
<a href="#Note_178"><span class="superscript">[178]</span></a>
After Dunmore, having lost his hold upon the situation,
escaped to the protection of a British vessel, the <i>Fowey</i>,
Colonel Preston continued to prevent surveys for officers' grants 
within the Transylvania territory; and his original hostility to Judge
Henderson gave place to friendship and support. 
</p>
<p>
On December 1st,
Colonel John Williams, resident agent of the Transylvania
Company, announced at Boonesborough the long-contemplated and
widely advertised advance in price of the lands, from twenty to
fifty shillings per hundred acres, with surveying fees of four
dollars 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
for tracts not exceeding six hundred and forty acres. 
<a href="#Note_179"><span class="superscript">[179]</span></a>
At a meeting of the Transylvania legislature, convened on December
21st, John Floyd was chosen surveyor general of the colony,
Nathaniel Henderson was placed in charge of the Entering Office,
and Richard Harrison given the post of secretary. At this meeting
of the legislature, the first open expression of discontent was
voiced in the "Harrodsburg Remonstrance," questioning the
validity of the proprietors' title, and protesting against any
increase in the price of lands, as well as the taking up by the
proprietors and a few other gentlemen of the best lands at the
Falls of the Ohio. Every effort was made to accommodate the
remonstrants, who were led by Abraham Hite. Office fees were
abolished, and the payment of quit-rents was deferred until
January 1, 1780. Despite these efforts at accommodation, grave
doubts were implanted by this Harrodsburg Remonstrance in the
minds of the people; and much discussion and discontent ensued.
</p>

<p>
By midsummer, 1775, George Rogers Clark, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
a remarkably enterprising and independent young pioneer, was "engrossing all
the land he could" in Kentucky. Upon his return to Virginia, as
he relates, he "found there was various oppinions Respecting
Henderson claim. many thought it go[o]d, others douted whether or
not Virginia coud with propriety have any pretentions to the
cuntrey." 
<a href="#Note_180"><span class="superscript">[180]</span></a>
Jefferson displayed a liberal attitude toward the
claims of the Transylvania proprietors; and Patrick Henry openly
stated that, in his opinion, "their claim would stand good." But
many others, of the stamp of George Mason and George Washington,
vigorously asserted Virginia's charter rights over the Western
territory. 
<a href="#Note_181"><span class="superscript">[181]</span></a>
This sharp difference of opinion excited in Clark's
mind the bold conception of seizing the leadership of the country
and making terms with Virginia under threat of secession. 
</p>
<p>
With the design of effecting some final disposition in regard to the
title of the Transylvania proprietors, Judge Henderson and Colonel 
Williams set off from Boonesborough 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
about May 1st, intending first to appeal to the Virginia Convention and
ultimately to lay their claims before the Continental Congress.
"Since they have gone," reports Floyd to Preston, "I am told most
of the men about Harrodsburg have re-assumed their former
resolution of not complying with any of the office rules
whatever. Jack Jones, it is said, is at the head of the party &amp;
flourishes away prodigiously." 
<a href="#Note_182"><span class="superscript">[182]</span></a>
John Gabriel Jones was the mere
figurehead in the revolt. The real leader, the brains of the
conspiracy, was the unscrupulous George Rogers Clark. At Clark's
instance, an eight-day election was held at Harrodsburg (June
7-15), at which time a petition to the Virginia Convention was
drawn up; 
<a href="#Note_183"><span class="superscript">[183]</span></a>
and Clark and Jones were elected delegates. Clark's
plan, the scheme of a bold revolutionist, was to treat with
Virginia for terms; and if they were not satisfactory, to revolt
and, as he says, "Establish an Independent Government" &hellip;
"giving away great part of the Lands and disposing of the
Remainder." In a second petition, prepared 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
by the self-styled "Committee of West Fincastle" (June 20th), it 
was alleged that "if these pretended Proprietors have leave to 
continue to act in their arbitrary manner out the controul of this 
colony [Virginia] the end must be evident to every well wisher to 
American Liberty."
<a href="#Note_184"><span class="superscript">[184]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The contest which now ensued between Richard Henderson and George
Rogers Clark, waged upon the floor of the convention and behind
the scenes, resulted in a conclusion that was inevitable at a
moment in American history marked by the signing of the
Declaration of Independence. Virginia, under the leadership of
her new governor, Patrick Henry, put an end to the proprietary
rule of the Transylvania Company. On December 7th such part of
Transylvania as lay within the chartered limits of Virginia was
erected by the legislature of that colony into the County of
Kentucky. The proprietary form of government with its "marks of
vassalage," although liberalized with the spirit of democracy,
was unendurable to the independent and lawless 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>    
pioneers, already intoxicated with the spirit of freedom swept in 
on the first fresh breezes of the Revolution. Yet it is not to be 
doubted that the Transylvania Company, through the courage and 
moral influence of its leaders, made a permanent contribution to 
the colonization of the West, which, in providential timeliness 
and effective execution, is without parallel in our early annals.
<a href="#Note_185"><span class="superscript">[185]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
While events were thus shaping themselves in Kentucky&mdash;events
which made possible Clark's spectacular and meteoric campaign in
the Northwest and ultimately resulted in the establishment of the
Mississippi instead of the Alleghanies as the western boundary of
the Confederation&mdash;the pioneers of Watauga were sagaciously
laying strong the foundations of permanent occupation. In
September, 1775, North Carolina, through her Provincial Congress,
provided for the appointment in each district of a Committee of
Safety, to consist of a president and twelve other members.
Following the lead thus set, the Watauga settlers assumed for
their country the name of 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>    
"Washington District"; and proceeded by
unanimous vote of the people to choose a committee of thirteen,
which included James Robertson and John Sevier. This district was
organized "shortly after October, 1775," according to Felix
Walker; and the first step taken after the election of the
committee was the organization of a court, consisting of five
members. Felix Walker was elected clerk of the court thus
organized, and held the position for about four years. James
Robertson and John Sevier, it is believed, were also members of
this court. To James Robertson who, with the assistance of his
colleagues, devised this primitive type of frontier rule&mdash;a true
commission form of government, on the "Watauga Plan"&mdash;is justly
due distinctive recognition for this notable inauguration of the
independent democracy of the Old Southwest. The Watauga
settlement was animated by a spirit of deepest loyalty to the
American cause. In a memorable petition these hardy settlers
requested the Provincial Council of North Carolina not to regard
them as a "lawless mob," 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>    
but to "annex" them to North Carolina without delay. "This committee 
(willing to become a party in the present unhappy contest)", states 
the petition, which must have been drafted about July 15, 1776, 
"resolved (which is now on our records), to adhere strictly to the 
rules and orders of the Continental Congress, and in open committee 
acknowledged themselves indebted to the united colonies their full 
proportion of the Continental expense."
<a href="#Note_186"><span class="superscript">[186]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
While these disputes as to the government of the new communities
were in progress an additional danger threatened the pioneers.
For a whole year the British had been plying the various Indian
tribes from the lakes to the gulf with presents, supplies, and
ammunition. In the Northwest bounties had actually been offered
for American scalps. During the spring of 1776 plans were
concerted, chiefly through Stuart and Cameron, British agents
among the Southern Indians, for uniting the Loyalists and the
Indians in a crushing attack upon the Tennessee settlements and
the back country of North Carolina. Already the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>    
frontier of South
Carolina had passed through the horrors of Indian uprising; and
warning of the approaching invasion had been mercifully sent the
Holston settlers by Atta-kulla-kulla's niece, Nancy Ward, the
"Pocahontas of the West"&mdash;doubtless through the influence of her
daughter, who loved Joseph Martin. The settlers, flocking for
refuge into their small stockaded forts, waited in readiness for
the dreaded Indian attacks, which were made by two forces
totaling some seven hundred warriors.
</p>

<p>
On July 20th, warned in advance of the approach of the Indians,
the borderers, one hundred and seventy in all, marched in two
columns from the rude breastwork, hastily thrown up at Eaton's
Station, to meet the Indians, double their own number, led by The
Dragging Canoe. The scouts surprised one party of Indians,
hastily poured in a deadly fire, and rushed upon them with such
impetuous fury that they fled precipitately. Withdrawing now
toward their breastwork, in anticipation of encountering there a
larger force, the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>    
backwoodsmen suddenly found themselves attacked
in their rear and in grave danger of being surrounded. Extending
their own line under the direction of Captain James Shelby, the
frontiersmen steadily met the bold attack of the Indians, who,
mistaking the rapid extension of the line for a movement to
retreat, incautiously made a headlong onslaught upon the whites,
giving the war-whoop and shouting: "The Unakas are running!" In
the ensuing hot conflict at close quarters, in some places hand
to hand, the Indians were utterly routed&mdash;The Dragging Canoe
being shot down, many warriors wounded, and thirteen left dead
upon the field.
</p>

<p>
On the day after Thompson, Cocke, Shelby, Campbell, Madison, and
their men were thus winning the battle of the Long Island
"flats," Robertson, Sevier, and their little band of forty-two
men were engaged in repelling an attack, begun at sunrise, upon
the Watauga fort near the Sycamore Shoals. This attack, which was
led by Old Abraham, proved abortive; but as the result of the
loose investment 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>    
of the log fortress, maintained by the Indians for several weeks, 
a few rash venturers from the fort were killed or captured, 
notably a young boy who was carried to one of the Indian towns 
and burned at the stake, and the wife of the pioneer settler, 
William Been, who was rescued from a like fate by the
intercession of the humane and noble Nancy Ward. It was during
this siege, according to constant tradition, that a frontier
lass, active and graceful as a young doe, was pursued to the very
stockade by the fleet-footed savages. Seeing her plight, an
athletic young officer mounted the stockade at a single leap,
shot down the foremost of the pursuers, and leaning over, seized
the maiden by the hands and lifted her over the stockade. The
maiden who sank breathless into the arms of the young officer,
John Sevier, was "Bonnie Kate Sherrill"&mdash;who, after the fashion
of true romance, afterward became the wife of her gallant
rescuer.
</p>

<p>
While the Tennessee settlements were undergoing the trials of
siege and attack, the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span> 
settlers on the frontiers of Rowan were
falling beneath the tomahawk of the merciless savage. In the
first and second weeks of July large forces of Indians penetrated
to the outlying settlements; and in two days thirty-seven persons
were killed along the Catawba River. On July 13th, the bluff old
soldier of Rowan, General Griffith Rutherford, reported to the
council of North Carolina that "three of our Captains are killed
and one wounded"; and that he was setting out that day with what
men he could muster to relieve Colonel McDowell, ten men, and one
hundred and twenty women and children, who were "besieged in some
kind of a fort." Aroused to extraordinary exertions by these
daring and deadly blows, the governments of North Carolina, South
Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia instituted a joint campaign
against the Cherokees. It was believed that, by delivering a
series of crushing blows to the Indians and so conclusively
demonstrating the overwhelming superiority of the whites, the
state governments in the Old Southwest would convince the savages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span> 
of the futility of any attempt ever again to oppose them
seriously.
</p>

<p>
Within less than a week after sending his despatches to the
council Rutherford set forth at the head of twenty-five hundred
men to protect the frontiers of North Carolina and to overwhelm
the foe. Leading the South Carolina army of more than eighteen
hundred men, Colonel Andrew Williamson directed his attack
against the lower Cherokee towns; while Colonel Samuel Jack led
two hundred Georgians against the Indian towns at the heads of
the Chattahoochee and Tugaloo Rivers. Assembling a force of some
sixteen hundred Virginians, Colonel William Christian
rendezvoused in August at the Long Island of Holston, where his
force was strengthened by between three and four hundred North
Carolinians under Colonels Joseph Williams and Love, and Major
Winston. The various expeditions met with little effective
opposition on the whole, succeeding everywhere in their design of
utterly laying waste the towns of the Cherokees. One serious
engagement occurred 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span> 
    when the Indians resolutely challenged
Rutherford's advance at the gap of the Nantahala Mountains.
Indian women&mdash;heroic Amazons disguised in war-paint and armed
with the weapons of warriors and the courage of despair&mdash;fought
side by side with the Indian braves in the effort to arrest
Rutherford's progress and compass his defeat. More than forty
frontiersmen fell beneath the deadly shots of this truly Spartan
band before the final repulse of the savages.
</p>

<p>
The most picturesque figures in this overwhelmingly successful
campaign were the bluff old Indian-fighter, Griffith Rutherford,
wearing "a tow hunting shirt, dyed black, and trimmed with white
fringe" as a uniform; Captain Benjamin Cleveland, a rude paladin
of gigantic size, strength, and courage; Lieutenant William
Lenoir (Le Noir), the gallant and recklessly brave French
Huguenot, later to win a general's rank in the Revolution; and
that militant man of God, the Reverend James Hall, graduate of
Nassau Hall, stalwart and manly, who carried a rifle on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span> 
shoulder and, in the intervals between the slaughter of the
savages, preached the gospel to the vindictive and bloodthirsty
backwoodsmen. Such preaching was sorely needed on that campaign&mdash;when
the whites, maddened beyond the bounds of self-control by
the recent ghastly murders, gladly availed themselves of the
South Carolina bounty offered for fresh Indian scalps. At times
they exultantly displayed the reeking patches of hair above the
gates of their stockades; at others, with many a bloody oath,
they compelled their commanders either to sell the Indian
captives into slavery or else see them scalped on the spot.
Twenty years afterward Benjamin Hawkins relates that among Indian
refugees in extreme western Georgia the children had been so
terrorized by their parents' recitals of the atrocities of the
enraged borderers in the campaign of 1776, that they ran
screaming from the face of a white man.

   The Colonization of the Cumberland
</p>
<p class="intro">
March 31, 1780. Set out this day, and after running some
distance, met with Col. Richard Henderson, who was running the
line between Virginia and North Carolina. At this meeting we were
much rejoiced. He gave us every information we wished, and
further informed us that he had purchased a quantity of corn in
Kentucky, to be shipped at the Falls of Ohio, for the use of the
Cumberland settlement. We are now without bread, and are
compelled to hunt the buffalo to preserve life.

the settlements in Tennessee and 
Kentucky, which they had seized and occupied, the pioneers held on 
with a tenacious grip which never relaxed. From these strongholds, 
won through sullen and desperate strokes, they pushed deeper into 
the wilderness, once again to meet with undimmed courage the bitter 
onslaughts of their resentful foes. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
The crushing of the Cherokees in 1776
relieved the pressure upon the Tennessee settlers, enabling them
to strengthen their hold and prepare effectively for future
eventualities; the possession of the gateway to Kentucky kept
free the passage for Western settlement; Watauga and its
defenders continued to offer a formidable barrier to British
invasion of the East from Kentucky and the Northwest during the
Revolution; while these Tennessee frontiersmen were destined soon
to set forth again to invade a new wilderness and at frightful
cost to colonize the Cumberland.
</p>

<p>
The little chain of stockades along the far-flung frontier of
Kentucky was tenaciously held by the bravest of the race, grimly
resolved that this chain must not break. The Revolution
precipitated against this chain wave after wave of formidable
Indian foes from the Northwest under British leadership. At the
very time when Griffith Rutherford set out for the relief of
McDowell's Fort, a marauding Indian band captured by stealth near
the Transylvania Fort, known as Boone's 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Fort (Boonesborough), Elizabeth and Frances Callaway, and Jemima 
Boone, the daughters of Richard Callaway and Daniel Boone, and 
rapidly marched them away toward the Shawanoe towns on the Ohio. 
A relief party, in two divisions, headed respectively by the young 
girls' fathers, and composed among others of the lovers of the 
three girls, Samuel Henderson, John Holder, and Flanders Callaway, 
pursued them with almost incredible swiftness. Guided by broken 
twigs and bits of cloth surreptitiously dropped by Elizabeth 
Callaway, they finally overtook the unsuspecting savages, killed 
two of them, and rescued the three maidens unharmed. This romantic
episode&mdash;which gave Fenimore Cooper the theme for the most
memorable scene in one of his Leatherstocking Tales&mdash;had an 
even more romantic sequel in the subsequent marriage of the three
pairs of lovers.
</p>

<p>
This bold foray, so shrewdly executed and even more sagaciously
foiled, was a true precursor of the dread happenings of the
coming years.  Soon the red men were lurking in the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
neighborhood of the stations; and relief was felt when the
Transylvania Fort, the great stockade planned by Judge Henderson,
was completed by the pioneers (July, 1776). Glad tidings arrived
only a few days later when the Declaration of Independence, read
aloud from the <i>Virginia Gazette</i>, was greeted with wild huzzas by
the patriotic backwoodsmen. During the ensuing months occasional
invasions were made by savage bands; but it was not until April
24, 1777, that Henderson's "big fort" received its first attack,
being invested by a company of some seventy-five savages. The
twenty-two riflemen in the fort drove off the painted warriors,
but not before Michael Stoner, Daniel Boone, and several others
were severely wounded. As he lay helpless upon the ground, his
ankle shattered by a bullet, Boone was lifted by Simon Kenton and
borne away upon his shoulders to the haven of the stockade amid a
veritable shower of balls. The stoical and taciturn Boone clasped
Kenton's hand and gave him the accolade of the wilderness in the
brief but heartfelt 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
utterance; "You are a fine fellow." On July
4th of this same year the fort was again subjected to siege, when
two hundred gaudily painted savages surrounded it for two days.
But owing to the vigilance and superb markmanship of the
defenders, as well as to the lack of cannon by the besieging
force, the Indians reluctantly abandoned the siege, after leaving
a number dead upon the field. Soon afterward the arrival of two
strong bodies of prime riflemen, who had been hastily summoned
from the frontiers of North Carolina and Virginia, once again
made firm the bulwark of white supremacy in the West.
</p>

<p>
Kentucky's terrible year, 1778, opened with a severe disaster to
the white settlers&mdash;when Boone with thirty men, while engaged in
making salt at the "Lower Salt Spring," was captured in February
by more than a hundred Indians, sent by Governor Hamilton of
Detroit to drive the white settlers from "Kentucke." Boone
remained in captivity until early summer, when, learning that his
Indian captors were planning an attack in force upon 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
the
Transylvania Fort, he succeeded in effecting his escape. After a
break-neck journey of one hundred and sixty miles, during which
he ate but one meal, Boone finally arrived at the big fort on
June 20th. The settlers were thus given ample time for
preparation, as the long siege did not begin until September 7th.
The fort was invested by a powerful force flying the English
flag&mdash;four hundred and forty-four savages gaudy in the vermilion
and ochre of their war-paint, and eleven Frenchmen, the whole
being commanded by the French-Canadian, Captain Dagniaux de
Quindre, and the great Indian Chief, Black-fish, who had adopted
Boone as a son. 
<a href="#Note_187"><span class="superscript">[187]</span></a>
In the effort to gain his end de Quindre resorted
to a dishonorable stratagem, by which he hoped to outwit the
settlers and capture the fort with but slight loss. "They formed
a scheme to deceive us," says Boone, "declaring it was their
orders, from Governor Hamilton, to take us captives, and not to
destroy us; but if nine of us would come out and treat with them,
they would immediately withdraw their forces from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
our walls, and
return home peacably." Transparent as the stratagem was, Boone
incautiously agreed to a conference with the enemy; Callaway
alone took the precaution to guard against Indian duplicity.
After a long talk, the Indians proposed to Boone, Callaway, and
the seven or eight pioneers who accompanied them that they shake
hands in token of peace and friendship. As picturesquely
described by Daniel Trabue:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Indians sayed two Indians must shake hands with one white
man to make a Double or sure peace at this time the Indians had
hold of the white men's hands and held them. Col. Calloway
objected to this but the other Indians laid hold or tryed to lay
hold of the other hand but Colonel Calloway was the first that
jerked away from them but the Indians seized the men two Indians
holt of one man or it was mostly the case and did their best to
hold them but while the man and Indians was a scuffling the men
from the Fort agreeable to Col. Calloway's order fired on them
they had a dreadful skuffel but our men all got in the fort safe
and the fire continued on both sides.
<a href="#Note_188"><span class="superscript">[188]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
During the siege Callaway, the leader of the pioneers, made a
wooden cannon wrapped with wagon tires, which on being fired at a
group of Indians "made them scamper perdidiously." The secret
effort of the Indians to tunnel a way underground into the fort,
being discovered by the defenders, was frustrated by a
countermine. Unable to outwit, outfight, or outmaneuver the
resourceful Callaway, de Quindre finally withdrew on September
16th, closing the longest and severest attack that any of the
fortified stations of Kentucky had ever been called upon to
withstand.
</p>

<p>
The successful defense of the Transylvania Fort, made by these
indomitable backwoodsmen who were lost sight of by the
Continental Congress and left to fight alone their battles in the
forests, was of national significance in its results. Had the
Transylvania Fort fallen, the northern Indians in overwhelming
numbers, directed by Hamilton and led by British officers, might
well have swept Kentucky free of defenders and fallen with
devastating force upon the exposed settlements along the western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
frontiers of North Carolina, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. This
defense of Boonesborough, therefore, is deserving of
commemoration in the annals of the Revolution, along with
Lexington and Bunker's Hill. Coupled with Clark's meteoric
campaign in the Northwest and the subsequent struggles in the
defense of Kentucky, it may be regarded as an event basically
responsible for the retention of the trans-Alleghany region by
the United States. The bitter struggles, desperate sieges, and
bloody reprisals of these dark years came to a close with the
expeditions of Clark and Logan in November, 1782, which
appropriately concluded the Revolution in the West by putting a
definite end to all prospect of formidable invasion of Kentucky.
</p>

<p>
In November, 1777, "Washington District," the delegates of which
had been received in the preceding year by the Provincial
Congress of North Carolina, was formed by the North Carolina
General Assembly into Washington County; and to it were assigned
the boundaries of the whole of the present state of Tennessee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
While this immense territory was thus being definitely included
within the bounds of North Carolina, Judge Henderson on behalf of
the Transylvania Company was making a vigorous effort to secure
the re&euml;stablishment of its rights from the Virginia Assembly. By
order of the Virginia legislature, an exhaustive investigation of
the claims of the Transylvania Company was therefore made,
hearings being held at various points in the back country. On
July 18, 1777, Judge Henderson presented to the peace
commissioners for North Carolina and Virginia at the Long Island
treaty ground an elaborate memorial in behalf of the Transylvania
Company, which the commissioners unanimously refused to consider,
as not coming under their jurisdiction. 
<a href="#Note_189"><span class="superscript">[189]</span></a>
Finally, after a full and
impartial discussion before the Virginia House of Delegates, that
body declared the Transylvania purchase void. 
<a href="#Note_190"><span class="superscript">[190]</span></a>
But in
consideration of "the very great expense [incurred by the
company] in making the said purchase, and in settling the said
lands, by which the commonwealth is likely to receive 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
great
advantage, by increasing its inhabitants, and establishing a
barrier against the Indians," the House of Delegates granted
Richard Henderson and Company two hundred thousand acres of land
situated between the Ohio and Green rivers, where the town of
Henderson, Kentucky, now stands. 
<a href="#Note_191"><span class="superscript">[191]</span></a>
With this bursting of the
Transylvania bubble and the vanishing of the golden dreams of
Henderson and his associates for establishing the fourteenth
American colony in the heart of the trans-Alleghany, a first
romantic chapter in the history of Westward expansion comes to a
close.
</p>

<p>
But another and more feasible project immediately succeeded.
Undiscouraged by Virginia's confiscation of Transylvania, and
disregarding North Carolina's action in extending her boundaries
over the trans-Alleghany region lying within her chartered
limits, Henderson, in whom the genius of the colonizer and the
ambition of the speculative capitalist were found in striking
conjunction, was now inspired to repeat, along broader and more
solidly practical lines, the revolutionary experiment 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
of Transylvania. It was not his purpose, however, to found an
independent colony; for he believed that millions of acres in the
Transylvania purchase lay within the bounds of North Carolina,
and he wished to open for colonization, settlement, and the sale
of lands, the vast wilderness of the valley of the Cumberland
supposed to lie within those confines. But so universal was the
prevailing uncertainty in regard to boundaries that it was
necessary to prolong the North Carolina-Virginia line in order to
determine whether or not the Great French Lick, the ideal
location for settlement, lay within the chartered limits of North
Carolina.
<a href="#Note_192"><span class="superscript">[192]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Judge Henderson's comprehensive plans for the promotion of an
extensive colonization of the Cumberland region soon began to
take form in vigorous action. Just as in his Transylvania project
Henderson had chosen Daniel Boone, the ablest of the North
Carolina pioneers, to spy out the land and select sites for
future location, so now he chose as leader of the new colonizing
party the ablest of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
Tennessee pioneers, James Robertson.
Although he was the acknowledged leader of the Watauga settlement
and held the responsible position of Indian agent for North
Carolina, Robertson was induced by Henderson's liberal offers to
leave his comparatively peaceful home and to venture his life in
this desperate hazard of new fortunes. The advance party of eight
white men and one negro, under Robertson's leadership, set forth
from the Holston settlement on February 6, 1779, to make a
preliminary exploration and to plant corn "that bread might be
prepared for the main body of emigrants in the fall." After
erecting a few cabins for dwellings and posts of defense,
Robertson plunged alone into the wilderness and made the long
journey to Post St. Vincent in the Illinois, in order to consult
with George Rogers Clark, who had entered for himself in the
Virginia Land Office several thousand acres of land at the French
Lick. After perfecting arrangements with Clark for securing
"cabin rights" should the land prove to lie in Virginia,
Robertson returned to Watauga 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
to take command of the migration.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of the year two parties set out, one by land, the
other by water, for the wonderful new country on the Cumberland
of which Boone and Scaggs and Mansker had brought back such
glowing descriptions. During the autumn Judge Henderson and other
commissioners from North Carolina, in conjunction with
commissioners from Virginia, had been running out the boundary
line between the two states. On the very day&mdash;Christmas,
1779&mdash;that Judge Henderson reached the site of the Transylvania
Fort, now called Boonesborough, the swarm of colonists from the
parent hive at Watauga, under Robertson's leadership, reached the
French Lick; and on New Year's Day, 1780, crossed the river on the
ice to the present site of Nashville.
</p>

<p>
The journal of the other party, which, as has been aptly said,
reads like a chapter from one of Captain Mayne Reid's fascinating
novels of adventure, was written by Colonel John Donelson, the
father-in-law of Andrew Jackson. Setting out from Fort Patrick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Henry on Holston River, December 22, 1779, with a flotilla
consisting of about thirty flatboats, dugouts, and canoes, they
encountered few difficulties until they began to run the gauntlet
of the Chickamauga towns on the Tennessee. Here they were
furiously attacked by the Indians, terrible in their red and
black war-paint; and a well-filled boat lagging in the rear, with
smallpox on board, was driven to shore by the Indians. The
occupants were massacred; but the Indians at once contracted the
disease and died by the hundreds. This luckless sacrifice of
"poor Stuart, his family and friends," while a ghastly price to
pay, undoubtedly procured for the Cumberland settlements
comparative immunity from Indian forays until the new-comers had
firmly established themselves in their wilderness stronghold.
Eloquent of the granite endurance and courageous spirit of the
typical American pioneer in its thankfulness for sanctuary, for
reunion of families and friends, and for the humble shelter of a
log cabin, is the last entry in Donelson's diary (April 24,
1780):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
This day we arrived at our journey's end at the Big Salt Lick,
where we have the pleasure of finding Capt. Robertson and his
company. It is a source of satisfaction to us to be enabled to
restore to him and others their families and friends, who were
intrusted to our care, and who, some time since, perhaps,
despaired of ever meeting again. Though our prospects at present
are dreary, we have found a few log cabins which have been built
on a cedar bluff above the Lick by Capt. Robertson and his
company.
<a href="#Note_193"><span class="superscript">[193]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the midst of the famine during this terrible period of the
"hard winter," Judge Henderson was sorely concerned for the fate
of the new colony which he had projected, and immediately
proceeded to purchase at huge cost a large stock of corn. On
March 5, 1780, this corn, which had been raised by Captain
Nathaniel Hart, was "sent from Boonesborough in perogues
[pettiaugers or flatboats] under the command of William Bailey
Smith.&hellip; This corn was taken down the Kentucky River, and
over the Falls of Ohio, to the mouth of the Cumberland, and
thence up that river to 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the fort at the French Lick. It is
believed have been the only bread which the settlers had until it
was raised there in 1781." 
<a href="#Note_194"><span class="superscript">[194]</span></a>
There is genuine impressiveness in
this heroic triumphing over the obstacles of obdurate nature and
this paternalistic provision for the exposed Cumberland
settlement&mdash;the purchase by Judge Henderson, the shipment by
Captain Hart, and the transportation by Colonel Smith, in an
awful winter of bitter cold and obstructed navigation, of this
indispensable quantity of corn purchased for sixty thousand
dollars in depreciated currency.
</p>

<p>
Upon his arrival at the French Lick, shortly after the middle of
April, Judge Henderson at once proceeded to organize a government
for the little community. On May 1st articles of association were
drawn up; and important additions thereto were made on May 13th,
when the settlers signed the complete series. The original
document, still preserved, was drafted by Judge Henderson, being
written throughout in his own handwriting; and his name heads the
list of two hundred and 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
fifty and more signatures. 
<a href="#Note_195"><span class="superscript">[195]</span></a>
The "Cumberland Compact," as this paper is called, is fundamentally a
mutual contract between the copartners of the Transylvania
Company and the settlers upon the lands claimed by the company.
It represents the collective will of the community; and on
account of the careful provisions safeguarding the rights of each
party to the contract it may be called a bill of rights. The
organization of this pure democracy was sound and
admirable&mdash;another notable early example of the commission form
of government. The most remarkable feature of this backwoods
constitution marks Judge Henderson as a pioneer in the use of the
political device so prominent to-day, one hundred and forty years
later&mdash;the "recall of judges." In the following striking clause
this innovation in government was recognized thus early in
American history as the most effective means of securing and
safeguarding justice in a democracy:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
As often as the people in general are dissatisfied with the
doings of the Judges or 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Triers so to be chosen, they may call a new election in any of the 
said stations, and elect others in their stead, having due respect 
to the number now agreed to be elected at each station, which 
persons so to be chosen shall have the same power with those in 
whose room or place they shall or may be chosen to act.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A land-office was now opened, the entry-taker being appointed by
Judge Henderson, in accordance with the compact; and the lands,
for costs of entry, etc., were registered for the nominal fee of
ten dollars per thousand acres. But as the Transylvania Company
was never able to secure a "satisfactory and indisputable title,"
the clause resulted in perpetual nonpayment. In 1783, following
the lead of Virginia in the case of Transylvania, North Carolina
declared the Transylvania Company's purchase void, but granted
the company in compensation a tract of one hundred and ninety
thousand acres in Powell's Valley. 
<a href="#Note_196"><span class="superscript">[196]</span></a>
As compensation, the grants of
North Carolina and Virginia were quite inadequate, considering
the value of the service in behalf of 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
permanent western
colonization rendered by the Transylvania company.
<a href="#Note_197"><span class="superscript">[197]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
James Robertson was chosen as presiding officer of the court of
twelve commissioners, and was also elected commander-in-chief of
the military forces of the eight little associated settlements on
the Cumberland. Here for the next two years the self-reliant
settlers under Robertson's wise and able leadership successfully
repelled the Indians in their guerrilla warfare, firmly
entrenched themselves in their forest-girt stronghold, and
vindicated their claim to the territory by right of occupation
and conquest. Here sprang up in later times a great and populous
city&mdash;named, strangely enough, neither for Henderson, the
founder, nor for Robertson and Donelson, the leaders of the two
colonizing parties, but for one having no association with its
history or origins, the gallant North Carolinian, General Francis
Nash, who was killed at the Battle of Germantown.

With the utmost satisfaction I can acquaint you with the sudden
and favorable turn of our public affairs. A few days ago

British and Tories waited at Charlotte for the reinforcement of

thoroughly had the Cherokees been 
subdued by the devastations of the campaign of 1776 that for 
several years thereafter they were unable to organize for a new 
campaign against the backwoodsmen along the frontiers of North 
Carolina and Tennessee. During these years the Holston settlers 
principally busied themselves in making their position secure, 
as well as in setting their house in order by severely punishing 
the lawless Tory element among them. In 1779 the Chickamaugas, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
with whom The
Dragging Canoe and his irreconcilable followers among the
Cherokees had joined hands after the campaign of 1776, grew so
bold in their bloody forays upon small exposed settlements that
North Carolina and Virginia in conjunction despatched a strong
expedition against them. Embarking on April 10th at the mouth of
Big Creek near the present Rogersville, Tennessee, three hundred
and fifty men led by Colonel Evan Shelby descended the Tennessee
to the fastnesses of the Chickamaugas. Meeting with no resistance
from the astonished Indians, who fled to the shelter of the
densely wooded hills, they laid waste the Indian towns and
destroyed the immense stores of goods collected by the British
agents for distribution among the red men. The Chickamaugas were
completely quelled; and during the period of great stress through
which the Tennessee frontiersmen were soon to pass, the Cherokees
were restrained through the wise diplomacy of Joseph Martin,
Superintendent of Indian affairs for Virginia.
</p>

<p>
The great British offensive against the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Southern colonies, which
were regarded as the vulnerable point in the American
Confederacy, was fully launched upon the fall of Charleston in
May, 1780. Cornwallis established his headquarters at Camden; and
one of his lieutenants, the persuasive and brilliant Ferguson,
soon rallied thousands of Loyalists in South Carolina to the
British standard. When Cornwallis inaugurated his campaign for
cutting Washington wholly off from the Southern colonies by
invading North Carolina, the men upon the western waters realized
that the time had come to rise, in defense of their state and in
protection of their homes. Two hundred Tennessee riflemen from
Sullivan County, under Colonel Isaac Shelby, were engaged in
minor operations in South Carolina conducted by Colonel Charles
McDowell; and conspicuous among these engagements was the affair
at Musgrove's Mill on August 18th when three hundred horsemen led
by Colonel James Williams, a native of Granville County, North
Carolina, Colonel Isaac Shelby, and Lieutenant-Colonel Clark of
Georgia repulsed 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
with heavy loss a British force of between four
and five hundred.
</p>

<p>
These minor successes availed nothing in face of the disastrous
defeat of Gates by Cornwallis at Camden on August 16th and the
humiliating blow to Sumter at Rocky Mount on the following day.
Ferguson hotly pursued the frontiersmen, who then retreated over
the mountains; and from his camp at Gilbert Town he despatched a
threatening message to the Western leaders, declaring that if
they did not desist from their opposition to the British arms and
take protection under his standard, he would march his army over
the mountains and lay their country waste with fire and sword.
Stung to action, Shelby hastily rode off to consult with Sevier
at his log castle near Jonesboro; and together they matured a
plan to arouse the mountain men and attack Ferguson by surprise.
In the event of failure, these wilderness free-lances planned to
leave the country and find a home with the Spaniards in
Louisiana.

Sycamore Shoals of the

an eloquent sermon was preached to them by that fiery man of God,
the Reverend Samuel Doak, who concluded his discourse with a
stirring invocation to the sword of the Lord and of Gideon&mdash;a
sentiment greeted with the loud applause of the militant
frontiersmen. Here and at various places along the march they
were joined by detachments of border fighters summoned to join
the expedition&mdash;Colonel William Campbell, who with some
reluctance had abandoned his own plans in response to Shelby's
urgent and repeated message, in command of four hundred hardy
frontiersmen from Washington County, Virginia; Colonel Benjamin
Cleveland, with the wild fighters of Wilkes known as "Cleveland's
Bulldogs"; Colonel Andrew Hampton, with the stalwart riflemen of

with the flower of the citizenry of Surry; the McDowells, Charles
and Joseph, with the bold borderers of Burke; Colonels Lacy and
Hill, with 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
well-trained soldiers of South Carolina; and
Brigadier-General James Williams, leading the intrepid Rowan
volunteers.
</p>

<p>
Before breaking camp at Quaker Meadows, the leading officers in
conference chose Colonel William Campbell as temporary officer of
the day, until they could secure a general officer from
headquarters as commander-in-chief. The object of the
mountaineers and big-game hunters was, in their own terms, to
pursue Ferguson, to run him down, and to capture him. In
pursuance of this plan, the leaders on arriving at the ford of
Green River chose out a force of six hundred men, with the best
mounts and equipment; and at daybreak on October 6th this force
of picked mounted riflemen, followed by some fifty "foot-cavalry"
eager to join in the pursuit, pushed rapidly on to the Cowpens.
Here a second selection took place; and Colonel Campbell, was
again elected commander of the detachment, now numbering some
nine hundred and ten horsemen and eighty odd footmen, which
dashed rapidly on in pursuit of Ferguson.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
The British commander had been apprised of the coming of the
over-mountain men. Scorning to make a forced march and attempt to
effect a junction with Cornwallis at Charlotte, Ferguson chose to
make a stand and dispose once for all of the barbarian horde whom
he denounced as mongrels and the dregs of mankind. After
despatching to Cornwallis a message asking for aid, Ferguson took
up his camp on King's Mountain, just south of the North Carolina
border line, in the present York County, South Carolina. Here,
after his pickets had been captured in silence, he was surprised
by his opponents. At three o'clock in the afternoon of October
7th the mountain hunters treed their game upon the heights.
</p>

<p>
The battle which ensued presents an extraordinary contrast in the
character of the combatants and the nature of the strategy and
tactics. 
<a href="#Note_199"><span class="superscript">[199]</span></a>
Each party ran true to form&mdash;Ferguson repeating
Braddock's suicidal policy of opposing bayonet charges to the
deadly fusillade of riflemen, who in Indian fashion were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
carefully posted behind trees and every shelter afforded by the
natural inequalities of the ground. In the army of the Carolina
and Virginia frontiersmen, composed of independent detachments
recruited from many sources and solicitous for their own
individual credit, each command was directed in the battle by its
own leader. Campbell&mdash;like Cleveland, Winston, Williams, Lacey,
Shelby, McDowell, Sevier, and Hambright&mdash;personally led his own
division; but the nature of the fighting and the peculiarity of
the terrain made it impossible for him, though the chosen
commander of the expedition, actually to play that r&ocirc;le in the
battle. The plan agreed upon in advance by the frontier leaders
was simple enough&mdash;to surround and capture Ferguson's camp on the
high plateau. The more experienced Indian fighters, Sevier and
Shelby, unquestionably suggested the general scheme which in any
case would doubtless have been employed by the frontiersmen; it
was to give the British "Indian play"&mdash;namely to take cover
everywhere and to fire from natural shelter. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Cleveland, a
Hercules in strength and courage who had fought the Indians and
recognized the wisdom of Indian tactics, ordered his men, as did
some of the other leaders, to give way before a bayonet charge,
but to return to the attack after the charge had spent its force.
</p>

<p>
"My brave fellows," said Cleveland, "every man must consider
himself an officer, and act from his own judgment. Fire as quick
as you can, and stand your ground as long as you can. When you
can do no better, get behind trees, or retreat; but I beg you not
to run quite off. If we are repulsed, let us make a point of
returning and renewing the fight; perhaps we may have better luck
in the second attempt than in the first."
</p>

<p>
The plateau upon which Ferguson was encamped was the top of an
eminence some six hundred yards long and about two hundred and
fifty yards from one base across to the other; and its shape was
that of an Indian paddle, varying from one hundred and twenty
yards at the blade to sixty yards at the handle in width.
Outcropping boulders upon the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
outer edge of the plateau afforded
some slight shelter for Ferguson's force; but, unsuspicious of
attack, Ferguson had made no abatis to protect his camp from the
assault to which it was so vulnerable because of the protection
of the timber surrounding it on all sides. As to the disposition
of the attacking force, the center to the northeast was occupied
by Cleveland with his "Bulldogs," Hambright with his South Fork
Boys from the Catawba (now Lincoln County, North Carolina), and
Winston with his Surry riflemen; to the south were the divisions
of Joseph McDowell, Sevier, and Campbell; while Lacey's South
Carolinians, the Rowan levies under Williams, and the Watauga
borderers under Shelby were stationed upon the north side.
Ferguson's forces consisted of Provincial Rangers, one hundred
and fifty strong, and other well-drilled Loyalists, between eight
and nine hundred in number; but his strength was seriously
weakened by the absence of a foraging party of between one and
two hundred who had gone off on the morning the battle occurred.
Shelby's men, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
before getting into position, received a hot fire,
the opening shots of the engagement. This inspired Campbell, who
now threw off his coat, to shout encouraging orders to his men
posted on the side of the mountain opposite to Shelby's force.
When Campbell's Virginians uttered a series of piercing shouts,
the British officer, De Peyster, second in command, remarked to
his chief: "These things are ominous&mdash;these are the damned
yelling boys."
</p>

<p>
The battle, which lasted some minutes short of an hour, was waged
with terrific ferocity. The Loyalist militia, whenever possible,
fired from the shelter of the rocks; while the Provincial Corps,
with fixed bayonets, steadily charged the frontiersmen, who fired
at close range and then rapidly withdrew to the very base of the
mountain. After each bayonet charge the Provincials coolly
withdrew to the summit, under the accumulating fire of the
returning mountaineers, who quickly gathered in their rear. Owing
to their elevated location, the British, although using the
rapid-fire breech-loading rifle invented by Ferguson 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
himself, found their vision deflected, and continually fired high, 
thus suffering from nature's handicap, refraction. 
<a href="#Note_200"><span class="superscript">[200]</span></a>
The militia, using sharpened butcher-knives which Ferguson had taught 
them to utilize as bayonets, charged against the mountaineers; but their
fire, in answer to the deadly fusillade of the expert squirrel-shooters,
was belated, owing to the fact that they could not fire
while the crudely improvised bayonets remained inserted in their
pieces. The Americans, continually firing upward, found ready
marks for their aim in the clearly delineated outlines of their
adversaries, and felt the fierce exultation which animates the
hunter who has tracked to its lair and surrounded wild game at
bay.
</p>

<p>
The leaders of the various divisions of the mountaineers bore
themselves with impetuous bravery, recklessly rushing between the
lines of fire and with native eloquence, interspersed with
profanity, rallying their individual commands again and again to
the attack. The valiant Campbell scaled the rugged heights,
loudly encouraging his men to the ascent. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Cleveland, resolutely facing the foe, urged on his Bulldogs with 
the inspiriting words: "Come, boys; let's try 'em again. We'll 
have better luck next time." No sooner did Shelby's men reach 
the bottom of the hill, in retreating before a charge, 
than their commander, fiery and strenuous, ardently shouted: 
"Now boys, quickly reload your rifles, and let's advance upon 
them, and give them another hell of a fire." The most deadly 
charge, led by De Peyster himself, fell upon Hambright's 
South Fork boys; and one of their gallant officers, Major 
Chronicle, waving his military hat, was mortally wounded, 
the command, "Face to the hill!", dying on his lips.
These veteran soldiers, unlike the mountaineers, firmly met the
shock of the charge, and a number of their men were shot down or
transfixed; but the remainder, reserving their fire until the
charging column was only a few feet away, poured in a deadly
volley before retiring. The gallant William Lenoir, whose
reckless bravery made him a conspicuous target for the enemy,
received several wounds 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
and emerged from the battle with his hair
and clothes torn by balls. The ranking American officer,
Brigadier-General James Williams, was mortally wounded while "on
the very top of the mountain, in the thickest of the fight"; and
as he momentarily revived, his first words were: "For God's sake,
boys, don't give up the hill." 
<a href="#Note_201"><span class="superscript">[201]</span></a>
Hambright, sorely wounded, his
boot overflowing with blood and his hat riddled with three bullet
holes, declined to dismount, but pressed gallantly forward,
exclaiming in his "Pennsylvania Dutch": "Huzza, my prave poys,
fight on a few minutes more, and the pattle will be over!" On the
British side, Ferguson was supremely valorous, rapidly dashing
from one point to another, rallying his men, oblivious to all
danger. Wherever the shrill note of his silver whistle sounded,
there the fighting was hottest and the British resistance the
most stubborn. His officers fought with the characteristic
steadiness of the British soldier; and again and again his men
charged headlong against the wavering and fiery circle of the
frontiersmen.
<a href="#Note_202"><span class="superscript">[202]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Ferguson's boast that "he was on King's Mountain, that he was
king of the Mountain, and God Almighty could not drive him from
it" was doubtless prompted, less by a belief in the
impregnability of his position, than by a desperate desire to
inspire confidence in his men. His location was admirably chosen
for defense against attack by troops employing regulation
tactics; but, never dreaming of the possibility of sudden
investment, Ferguson had erected no fortifications for his
encampment. His frenzied efforts on the battle-field seem like a
mad rush against fate; for the place was indefensible against the
peculiar tactics of the frontiersmen. While the mountain flamed
like a volcano and resounded with the thunder of the guns, a
steady stricture was in progress. The lines were drawn tighter
and tighter around the trapped and frantically struggling army;
and at last the fall of their commander, riddled with bullets,
proved the tragic futility of further resistance. The game was
caught and bagged to a man. When Winston, with his fox-hunters of
Surry, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
dashed recklessly through the woods, says a chronicler of
the battle, and the last to come into position,
</p>

<div class="poem1">
<p class="poem1">Flow'd in, and settling, circled all the lists,
</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">
then
</p>

<div class="poem1">
    <p class="poem1">From all the circle of the hills</p>
    <p class="poem2">death sleeted in upon the doomed.</p>
</div>

<p>
The battle was decisive in its effect&mdash;shattering the plans of
Cornwallis, which till then appeared certain of success. The
victory put a full stop to the invasion of North Carolina, which
was then well under way. Cornwallis abandoned his carefully
prepared campaign and immediately left the state. After
ruthlessly hanging nine prisoners, an action which had an
effectively deterrent effect upon future Tory murders and
depredations, the patriot force quietly disbanded. The brilliant
initiative of the buckskin-clad borderers, the strenuous energy
of their pursuit, the perfection of their surprise&mdash;all
reinforced by the employment of ideal tactics for meeting the
given situation&mdash;were the controlling factors 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
in this
overwhelming victory of the Revolution. The pioneers of the Old
Southwest&mdash;the independent and aggressive yeomanry of North
Carolina, Virginia, and South Carolina&mdash;had risen in their might.
Without the aid or authority of blundering state governments,
they had created an army of frontiersmen, Indian-fighters, and
big-game hunters which had found no parallel or equal on the
continent since the Battle of the Great Kanawha.

   The State of Franklin

<p class="intro">
Designs of a more dangerous nature and deeper die seem to glare
in the western revolt.&hellip; I have thought proper to issue this
manifesto, hereby warning all persons concerned in the said
revolt &hellip; that the honour of this State has been particularly
wounded, by seizing that by violence which, in time, no doubt,
would have been obtained by consent, when the terms of separation
would have been explained or stipulated, to the mutual
satisfaction of the mother and new State.&hellip; Let your
proposals be consistent with the honour of the State to accede

</p>
<p class="intro-source">
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Governor Alexander Martin</span>: 
Manifesto against the State of Franklin, April 25, 1785.
</p>

<br>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">o</span> 
the shrewd diplomacy of Joseph Martin, 
who held the Cherokees in check during the period of the King's 
Mountain campaign, the settlers in the valleys of the Watauga and 
the Holston owed their temporary immunity from Indian attack. But 
no sooner did Sevier and his over-mountain men return from the 
battle-field of King's Mountain than they were called upon to join 
in an expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
against the Cherokees, who had again gone on the war-path at the
instigation of the British. After Sevier with his command had
defeated a small party of Indians at Boyd's Creek in December,
the entire force of seven hundred riflemen, under the command of
Colonel Arthur Campbell, with Major Joseph Martin as subordinate,
penetrated to the heart of the Indian country, burned Echota,
Chilhowee, Settiquo, Hiawassee, and seven other principal
villages, and destroyed an immense amount of property and
supplies. In March, suspecting that the arch-conspirators against
the white settlers were the Cherokees at the head waters of the
Little Tennessee, Sevier led one hundred and fifty horsemen
through the devious mountain defiles and struck the Indians a
swift and unexpected blow at Tuckasegee, near the present
Webster, North Carolina. In this extraordinarily daring raid, one
of his most brilliant feats of arms, Sevier lost only one man
killed and one wounded; while upon the enemy he inflicted the
loss of thirty killed, took many more prisoners, burned six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
Indian towns, and captured many horses and supplies. Once his
deadly work was done, Sevier with his bold cavaliers silently
plunged again into the forest whence he had so suddenly emerged,
and returned in triumph to the settlements.
</p>

<p>
Disheartened though the Indians were to see the smoke of their
burning towns, they sullenly remained averse to peace; and they
did not keep the treaty made at Long Island in July, 1781. The
Indians suffered from very real grievances at the hands of the
lawless white settlers who persisted in encroaching upon the
Indian lands. When the Indian ravages were resumed, Sevier and
Anderson, the latter from Sullivan County, led a punitive
expedition of two hundred riflemen against the Creeks and the
Chickamaugas; and employing the customary tactics of laying waste
the Indian towns, administered stern and salutary chastisement to
the copper-colored marauders.
</p>

<p>
During this same period the settlers on the Cumberland were
displaying a grim fortitude and stoical endurance in the face of
Indian 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
attack forever memorable in the history of the Old
Southwest. On the night of January 15, 1781, the settlers at
Freeland's Station, after a desperate resistance, succeeded in
beating off the savages who attacked in force. At Nashborough on
April 2d, twenty of the settlers were lured from the stockade by
the artful wiles of the savages; and it was only after serious
loss that they finally won their way back to the protection of
the fort. Indeed, their return was due to the fierce dogs of the
settlers, which were released at the most critical moment, and
attacked the astounded Indians with such ferocity that the
diversion thus created enabled the settlers to escape from the
deadly trap. During the next two years the history of the
Cumberland settlements is but the gruesome recital of murder
after murder of the whites, a few at a time, by the lurking
Indian foe. Robertson's dominant influence alone prevented the
abandonment of the sorely harassed little stations. The arrival
of the North Carolina commissioners for the purpose of laying off
bounty lands and settlers' preemptions, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
and the treaty of peace
concluded at the French Lick on November 5 and 6, 1783, gave
permanence and stability to the Cumberland settlements. The
lasting friendship of the Chickasaws was won; but the Creeks for
some time continued to harass the Tennessee pioneers. The
frontiersmen's most formidable foe, the Cherokees, stoically,
heroically fighting the whites in the field, and smallpox,
syphilis, and drunkenness at home, at last abandoned the unequal
battle. The treaty at Hopewell on November 28, 1785, marks the
end of an era&mdash;the Spartan yet hopeless resistance of the
intrepid red men to the relentless and frequently unwarranted
expropriation by the whites of the ancient and immemorial domain
of the savage.
</p>

<p>
The skill in self-government of the isolated people beyond the
mountains, and the ability they had already demonstrated in the
organization of "associations," received a strong stimulus on
June 2, 1784, when the legislature of North Carolina ceded to the
Congress of the United States the title which that state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
possessed to the land west of the Alleghanies. Among the terms of
the Cession Act were these conditions: that the ceded territory
should be formed into a separate state or states; and that if
Congress should not accept the lands thus ceded and give due
notice within two years, the act should be of no force and the
lands should revert to North Carolina. 
<a href="#Note_203"><span class="superscript">[203]</span></a>
No sooner did this news
reach the Western settlers than they began to mature plans for
the organization of a government during the intervening twelve
months. Their exposed condition on the frontiers, still harassed
by the Indians, and North Carolina's delay in sending goods
promised the Indians by a former treaty, both promoted Indian
hostility; and these facts, combined with their remote location
beyond the mountains, rendering them almost inaccessible to
communication with North Carolina&mdash;all rendered the decision of
the settlers almost inevitable. Moreover, the allurements of high
office and the dazzling dreams of ambition were additional
motives sufficiently human in themselves to give driving 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
power to the movement toward independence.
</p>

<p>
At a convention assembled at Jonesborough on August 23, 1784,
delegates from the counties of Washington, Sullivan, and Greene
characteristically decided to organize an "Association." They
solemnly declared by resolution: "We have a just and undeniable
right to petition to Congress to accept the session made by North
Carolina, and for that body to countenance us for forming
ourselves into a separate government, and to frame either a
permanent or temporary constitution, agreeably to a resolve of
Congress.&hellip;" Meanwhile, Governor Martin, largely as the
result of the prudent advice of North Carolina's representative
in Congress, Dr. Hugh Williamson, was brought to the conclusion
that North Carolina, in the passage of the cession act, had acted
precipitately. This important step had been taken without the
full consideration of the people of the state. Among the various
arguments advanced by Williamson was the impressive contention
that, in accordance 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
with the procedure in the case of other
states, the whole expense of the huge Indian expeditions in 1776
and the heavy militia aids to South Carolina and Georgia should
be credited to North Carolina as partial fulfilment of her
continental obligations before the cession should be irrevocably
made to the Federal government. Williamson's arguments proved
convincing; and it was thus primarily for economic reasons of 
far-reaching national importance that the assembly of North Carolina
(October 22 to November 25, 1784) repealed the cession act made
the preceding spring.
<a href="#Note_204"><span class="superscript">[204]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
Before the news of the repeal of the cession act could reach the
western waters, a second convention met at Jonesborough on
December 17th. Sentiment at this time was much divided, for a
number of the people, expecting the repeal of the cession act,
genuinely desired a continued allegiance to North Carolina. Of
these may well have been John Sevier, who afterward declared to
Joseph Martin that he had been "Draged into the Franklin 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
measures by a large number of the people of this country." 
<a href="#Note_205"><span class="superscript">[205]</span></a>
The principal
act of this convention was the adoption of a temporary
constitution for six months and the provision for a convention to
be held within one year, at the expiration of which time this
constitution should be altered, or adopted as the permanent
constitution of the new state. 
<a href="#Note_206"><span class="superscript">[206]</span></a>
The scholars on the western
waters, desiring to commemorate their aspirations for freedom,
chose as the name of the projected new state: "Frankland"&mdash;the
Land of the Free. The name finally chosen, however, perhaps for
reasons of policy, was "Franklin," in honor of Benjamin Franklin.
Meanwhile, in order to meet the pressing needs for a stable
government along the Tennessee frontier, the North Carolina
assembly, which repealed the cession act, created out of the four
western counties the District of Washington, with John Haywood as
presiding judge and David Campbell as associate, and conferred
upon John Sevier the rank of brigadier-general of the new
district. The first week in December 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Governor Martin sent to
Sevier his military commission; and replying to Joseph Martin's
query (December 31, 1784, prompted by Governor Martin) as to
whether, in view of the repeal of the cession act, he intended to
persist in revolt or await developments, Sevier gave it out
broadcast that "we shall pursue no furtheir measures as to a new
State."
</p>

<p>
Owing to the remoteness of the Tennessee settlements and the
difficulty of appreciating through correspondence the atmosphere
of sentiment in Franklin, Governor Martin realized the necessity
of sending a personal representative to discover the true state
of affairs in the disaffected region beyond the mountains. For
the post of ambassador to the new government, Governor Martin
selected a man distinguished for mentality and diplomatic skill,
a pioneer of Tennessee and Kentucky, Judge Richard Henderson's
brother, Colonel Samuel Henderson. Despite Sevier's disavowal of
any further intention to establish a new state, the governor gave
Colonel Henderson elaborate written instructions, the purport 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
of which was to learn all that he could about the political
complexion of the Tennessee frontiersmen, the sense of the
people, and the agitation for a separate commonwealth. Moreover,
in the hope of placating the leading chieftains of the Cherokees,
who had bitterly protested against the continued aggressions and
encroachments upon their lands by the lawless borderers, he
instructed Colonel Henderson also to learn the temper and
dispositions of the Indians, and to investigate the case of
Colonel James Hubbardt who was charged with the murder of Untoola
of Settiquo, a chief of the Cherokees.
</p>

<p>
When Colonel Henderson arrived at Jonesborough, he found the
third Franklin legislature in session, and to this body he
presented Governor Martin's letter of February 27, 1785. In
response to the governor's request for an "account of the late
proceedings of the people in the western country," an extended
reply was drafted by the new legislature; and this letter,
conveyed to Governor Martin by Colonel Henderson, in setting
forth in detail 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
the reasons for the secession, made the following
significant statement: "We humbly thank North Carolina for every
sentiment of regard she has for us, but are sorry to observe,
that as it is founded upon principles of interest, as is aparent
from the tenor of your letter, we are doubtful, when the cause
ceases which is the basis of that affection, we shall lose your
esteem." At the same time (March 22nd), Sevier, who had just been
chosen Governor of the State of Franklin, transmitted to Governor
Martin by Colonel Henderson a long letter, not hitherto published
in any history of the period, in which he outspokenly says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It gives me great pain to think there should arise any Disputes
between us and North Carolina, &amp; I flatter myself when North
Carolina states the matter in a fair light she will be fully
convinced that necessity and self-preservation have Compelled Us
to the measures we Have taken, and could the people have
discovered that No. Carolina would Have protected and Govern'd
them, They would have remained where they were; but they
perceived 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
a neglect and Coolness, and the Language of Many of
your most leading members Convinced them they were Altogether
Disregarded. <a href="#Note_207"><span class="superscript">[207]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">
Following the issuance of vigorous manifestos by Martin (April
25th) and Sevier (May 15th), 
<a href="#Note_208"><span class="superscript">[208]</span></a>
the burden of the problem fell upon
Richard Caswell, who in June succeeded Martin as Governor of
North Carolina.
</p>

<p>
Meantime the legislature of the over-mountain men had given the
name of Franklin to the new state, although for some time it
continued to be called by many Frankland, and its adherents
Franks. The legislature had also established an academy named
after Governor Martin, and had appointed (March 12th) William
Cocke as a delegate to the Continental Congress, urging its
acceptance of the cession. In the Memorial from the Franklin
legislature to the Continental Congress, dealing in some detail
with North Carolina's failure to send the Cherokees some goods
promised them for lands acquired by treaty, it is alleged:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
She [North Carolina] immediately stoped the goods she had
promised to give the Indians for the said land which so
exasperated them that they begun to commit hostalities on our
frontiers in this situation we were induced to a declaration of
Independence not doubting we should be excused by Congress &hellip; as
North Carolina seemed quite regardless of our interest and the
Indians daily murdering our friends and relations without
distinction of age or sex.

<p>
Sympathizing with the precarious situation of the settlers, as
well as desiring the cession, Congress urged North Carolina to
amend the repealing act and execute a conveyance of the western
territory to the Union.

Among the noteworthy features of the Franklin movement was the
constitution prepared by a committee, headed by the Reverend
Samuel Houston of Washington County, and presented at the meeting
of the Franklin legislature, Greeneville, November 14, 1785. This
eccentric constitution was based in considerable part upon the
North Carolina model; but it was "rejected in the lump" and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
constitution of North Carolina, almost unchanged, was adopted.
Under this Houston constitution, the name "Frankland" was chosen
for the new state. The legislature was to consist of but a single
house. In a section excluding from the legislature "ministers of
the gospel, attorneys at law, and doctors of physics," those were
declared ineligible for office who were of immoral character or
guilty of "such flagrant enormities as drunkenness, gaming,
profane swearing, lewdness, Sabbath-breaking and such like," or
who should deny the existence of God, of heaven, and of hell, the
inspiration of the Scriptures, or the existence of the Trinity.
Full religious liberty and the rights of conscience were
assured&mdash;but strict orthodoxy was a condition for eligibility to
office. No one should be chosen to office who was "not a scholar
to do the business." This remarkable document, which provided for
many other curious innovations in government, was the work of
pioneer doctrinaires&mdash;Houston, Campbell, Cocke, and Tipton&mdash;and
deserves 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
study as a bizarre reflection of the spirit and genius
of the western frontiersmen.
<a href="#Note_210"><span class="superscript">[210]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The liberal policy of Martin, followed by the no less
conciliatory attitude of his successor, Caswell, for the time
proved wholly abortive. However, Martin's appointment of Evan
Shelby in Sevier's place as brigadier, and of Jonathan Tipton as
colonel of his county, produced disaffection among the Franks;
and the influence of Joseph Martin against the new government was
a powerful obstacle to its success. At first the two sets of
military, civil, and judicial officers were able to work amicably
together; and a working-basis drawn up by Shelby and Sevier,
although afterward repudiated by the Franklin legislature,
smoothed over some of the rapidly accumulating difficulties. The
persistent and quiet assertion of authority by North Carolina,
without any overt act of violence against the officers of
Franklin state, revealed great diplomatic skill in Governors
Martin and Caswell. It was doubtless the considerate policy of
the latter, coupled with the defection from Sevier's cause 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
of men
of the stamp of Houston and Tipton, after the blundering and
cavalier rejection of their singular constitution, which
undermined the foundations of Franklin. Sevier himself later
wrote with considerable bitterness: "I have been faithfull, and
my own breast acquits myself that I have acted no part but what
has been Consistent with honor and justice, tempered with
Clemency and mercy. How far our pretended patriots have supported
me as their pretended chiefe magistrate, I leave the world at
large to Judge." Arthur Campbell's plans for the formation of a
greater Franklin, through the union of the people on the western
waters of Virginia with those of North Carolina, came to nought
when Virginia in the autumn of 1785 with stern decisiveness
passed an act making it high treason to erect an independent
government within her limits unless authorized by the assembly.
Sevier, however, became more fixed in his determination to
establish a free state, writing to Governor Caswell: "We shall
continue to act independent and would rather suffer death, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
in all
its various and frightful shapes, than conform to anything that
is disgraceful." North Carolina, now proceeding with vigor
(November, 1786), fully reassumed its sovereignty and
jurisdiction over the mountain counties, but passed an act of
pardon and oblivion, and in many ways adopted moderate and
conciliatory measures.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Page_324_2" id="Page_324_2"></a>
Driven to extremities, Cocke and Sevier in turn appealed for aid
and advice to Benjamin Franklin, in whose honor the new state had
been named. In response to Cocke, Franklin wrote (August 12,
1786): "I think you are perfectly right in resolving to submit
them [the Points in Dispute] to the Decision of Congress and to
abide by their Determination." 
<a href="#Note_211"><span class="superscript">[211]</span></a>
Franklin's views change in the
interim; for when, almost a year later, Sevier asks him for
counsel, Franklin has come to the conclusion that the wisest move
for Sevier was not to appeal to Congress, but to endeavor to
effect some satisfactory compromise with North Carolina (June 30,
1787):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
There are only two Things that Humanity induces me to wish you
may succeed in: The Accomodating your Misunderstanding with the
Government of North Carolina, by amicable Means; and the Avoiding
an Indian war, by preventing Encroaching on their Lands.&hellip;
The Inconvenience to your People attending so remote a Seat of
Government, and the difficulty to that Government in ruling well
so remote a People, would I think be powerful Inducements with
it, to accede to any fair &amp; reasonable Proposition it may receive
from you towards an Accommodation.
<a href="#Note_212"><span class="superscript">[212]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Despite Sevier's frenzied efforts to achieve independence&mdash;his
treaty with the Indians, his sensational plan to incorporate the
Cherokees into the new state, his constancy to an ideal of revolt
against others in face of the reality of revolt against himself,
his struggle, equivocal and half-hearted, with the North Carolina
authorities under Tipton&mdash;despite all these heroic efforts, the
star of Franklin swiftly declined. The vigorous measures pursued
by General Joseph Martin, and his effective influence focussed
upon a movement already honey-combed 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
with disaffection, finally
turned the scale. To the Franklin leaders he sent the urgent
message: "Nothing will do but a submission to the laws of North
Carolina." Early in April, 1788, Martin wrote to Governor
Randolph of Virginia: "I returned last evening from Green Co.
Washington destrict, North Carolina, after a tower through that
Co'ntry, and am happy to inform your Excellency that the late
unhappy dispute between the State of North Carolina, and the
pretended State of Franklin is subsided." Ever brave, constant,
and loyal to the interest of the pioneers, Sevier had originally
been drawn into the movement against his best judgment. Caught in
the unique trap, created by the passage of the cession act and
the sudden <i>volte-face</i> of its repeal, he struggled desperately to
extricate himself. Alone of all the leaders, the governor of
ill-starred Franklin remained recalcitrant.

&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Sevier</span> to Don Diego de

</p>

<p class="intro">
From the early settlements in the eastern parts of this Continent
to the late &amp; more recent settlements on the Kentucky in the West
the same difficulties have constantly occurred which now oppress

<br>

<p class="noindent">
<span class="dropcap">A</span>
<span class="smcap">strange</span> 
sham-battle, staged like 
some scene from <i>op&eacute;ra bouffe</i>,
in the bleak snow-storm of February, 1788, is really the prelude
to a remarkable drama of revolt in which Sevier, Robertson,
Bledsoe, and the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Cumberland stalwarts play the leading r&ocirc;les. On
February 27th, incensed beyond measure by the action of Colonel
John Tipton in harboring some of his slaves seized by the sheriff
under an execution issued by one of the North Carolina courts,
Sevier with one hundred and fifty adherents besieged Tipton with
a few of his friends in his home on Sinking Creek. The siege was
raised at daybreak on February 29th by the arrival of
reinforcements under Colonel Maxwell from Sullivan County; and
Sevier, who was unwilling to precipitate a conflict, withdrew his
forces after some desultory firing, in which two men were killed
and several wounded. Soon afterward Sevier sent word to Tipton
that on condition his life be spared he would submit to North
Carolina. On this note of tragi-comedy the State of Franklin
appeared quietly to expire. The usually sanguine Sevier, now
thoroughly chastened, sought shelter in the distant settlements&mdash;deeply
despondent over the humiliating failure of his plans and
the even more depressing defection of his erstwhile friends and
supporters. 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
The revolutionary designs and separatist tendencies
which he still harbored were soon to involve him in a secret
conspiracy to give over the State of Franklin into the protection
of a foreign power.
</p>

<p>
The fame of Sevier's martial exploits and of his bold stroke for
independence had long since gone abroad, astounding even so
famous an advocate of liberty as Patrick Henry and winning the
sympathy of the Continental Congress. One of the most interested
observers of the progress of affairs in the State of Franklin was
Don Diego de Gardoqui, who had come to America in the spring of
1785, bearing a commission to the American Congress as Spanish
charg&eacute; d'affaires (<i>Encargados de Negocios</i>) to the 
United States. In the course of his negotiations with Jay 
concerning the right of navigation of the Mississippi River, 
which Spain denied to the Americans, Gardoqui was not long in 
discovering the violent resentment of the Western frontiersmen, 
provoked by Jay's crass blunder in proposing that the American 
republic, in return for reciprocal 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
foreign advantages offered by Spain, should waive for
twenty-five years her right to navigate the Mississippi. The
Cumberland traders had already felt the heavy hand of Spain in
the confiscation of their goods at Natchez; but thus far the
leaders of the Tennessee frontiersmen had prudently restrained
the more turbulent agitators against the Spanish policy, fearing
lest the spirit of retaliation, once aroused, might know no
bounds. Throughout the entire region of the trans-Alleghany, a
feeling of discontent and unrest prevailed&mdash;quite as much the
result of dissatisfaction with the central government which
permitted the wholesale restraint of trade, as of resentment
against the domination of Spain.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had the shrewd and watchful Gardoqui, who was eager to
utilize the separatist sentiment of the western settlements in
the interest of his country, learned of Sevier's armed
insurrection against the authority of North Carolina than he
despatched an emissary to sound the leading men of Franklin and
the Cumberland settlements in regard to an 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
alliance. This secret
emissary was Dr. James White, who had been appointed by the
United States Government as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for
the Southern Department on November 29, 1786. Reporting as
instructed to Don Estevan Mir&oacute;, governor of Louisiana, White, the
corrupt tool of Spain, stated concerning his confidential mission
that the leaders of "Frankland" and "Cumberland district" had
"eagerly accepted the conditions" laid down by Gardoqui: to take
the oath of allegiance to Spain, and to renounce all submission
or allegiance whatever to any other sovereign or power. Satisfied
by the secret advices received, the Spanish minister reported to
the home authorities his confident belief that the Tennessee
backwoodsmen, if diplomatically handled, would readily throw in
their lot with Spain.
<a href="#Note_214"><span class="superscript">[214]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
After the fiasco of his siege of Tipton's home, Sevier had seized
upon the renewal of hostilities by the Cherokees as a means of
regaining his popularity. This he counted upon doing by rallying
his old comrades-in-arms 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
under his standard and making one of his
meteoric, whirlwind onslaughts upon their ancient Indian foe. The
victory of this erstwhile popular hero, the beloved "Nolichucky
Jack of the Border," over the Indians at a town on the Hiwassee
"so raised him in the esteem of the people on the frontier,"
reports Colonel Maxwell, "that the people began [once more] to
flock to his standard." Inspirited by this good turn in his
fortunes, Sevier readily responded to Dr. White's overtures.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed early in the year over the unprovoked depredations and
murders by the Indians in several Tennessee counties and on the
Kentucky road, Sevier, Robertson, and Anthony Bledsoe had
persuaded Governor Samuel Johnston of North Carolina to address
Gardoqui and request him to exert his influence to prevent
further acts of savage barbarity. In letters to Governor
Johnston, to Robertson, and to Sevier, all of date April 18th,
Gardoqui expressed himself in general as being "extremely
surprised to know that there is a suspicion that the good
government 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
of Spain is encouraging these acts of barbarity." The
letters to Robertson and Sevier, read between the lines as
suggestive reinforcements of Spain's secret proposals, possess
real significance. The letter to Sevier contains this dexterously
expressed sentiment: "His Majesty is very favorably inclined to
give the inhabitants of that region all the protection that they
ask for and, on my part, I shall take very great pleasure in
contributing to it on this occasion and other occasions."
</p>

<p>
This letter, coupled with the confidential proposals of Dr.
White, furnished a convenient opening for correspondence with the
Spaniards; and in July Sevier wrote to Gardoqui indicating his
readiness to accede to their proposals. After secret conferences
with men who had supported him throughout the vicissitudes of his
ill-starred state, Sevier carefully matured his plans. The
remarkable letter of great length which he wrote to Gardoqui on
September 12, 1788, reveals the conspiracy in all its details and
presents in vivid colors the strong separatist sentiment of the
day. Sevier 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
urgently petitions Gardoqui for the loan of a few
thousand pounds, to enable him to "make the most expedient and
necessary preparations for defense"; and offers to repay the loan
within a short time "by sending the products of this region to
the lower ports." Upon the vital matter of "delivering" the State
of Franklin to Spain, he forthrightly says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Since my last of the 18th of July, upon consulting with the
principal men of this country, I have been particularly happy to
find that they are equally disposed and ready as I am to accept
your propositions and guarantees. You may be sure that the
pleasing hopes and ideas which the people of this country hold
with regard to the probability of an alliance with, and
commercial concessions from, you are very ardent, and that we are
unanimously determined on that score. The people of this region
have come to realize truly upon what part of the world and upon
which nation their future happiness and security depend, and they
immediately infer that their interest and prosperity depend
entirely upon the protection and liberality of your government.&hellip;
Being the first from this side of the Appalachian Mountains
to resort in this way to your 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
protection and liberality, we feel
encouraged to entertain the greatest hope that we shall be
granted all reasonable aid by him who is so amply able to do it,
and to give the protection and help that is asked of him in this
petition. You know our delicate situation and the difficulties in
which we are in respect to our mother State which is making use
of every strategem to impede the development and prosperity of
this country.&hellip; Before I conclude, it may be necessary to
remind you that there will be no more favorable occasion than the
present one to put this plan into execution. North Carolina has
rejected the Constitution and moreover it seems to me that a
considerable time will elapse before she becomes a member of the
Union, if that event ever happens.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Through Mir&oacute;, Gardoqui was simultaneously conducting a similar
correspondence with General James Wilkinson. The object of the
Spanish conspiracy, matured as the result of this correspondence,
was to seduce Kentucky from her allegiance to the United States.
Despite the superficial similarity between the situation of
Franklin and Kentucky, it would be doing Sevier and his adherents
a capital 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
injustice to place them in the category of the corrupt
Wilkinson and the malodorous Sebastian. Moreover, the
secessionists of Franklin, as indicated in the above letter, had
the excuse of being left virtually without a country. On the
preceding August 1st, North Carolina had rejected the
Constitution of the United States; and the leaders of Franklin,
who were sorely aggrieved by what they regarded as her
indifference and neglect, now felt themselves more than ever out
of the Union and wholly repudiated by the mother state. Again,
Sevier had the embittered feeling resultant from outlawry.
Because of his course in opposing the laws and government of
North Carolina and in the killing of several good citizens,
including the sheriff of Washington County, by his forces at
Sinking Creek, Sevier, through the action of Governor Johnston of
North Carolina, had been attainted of high treason. Under the
heavy burden of this grave charge, he felt his hold upon Franklin
relax. Further, an atrocity committed in the recent campaign
under 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Sevier's leadership&mdash;Kirk's brutal murder of Corn Tassel, a
noble old Indian, and other chieftains, while under the
protection of a flag of truce&mdash;had placed a bar sinister across
the fair fame of this stalwart of the border. Utter desperation
thus prompted Sevier's acceptance of Gardoqui's offer of the
protection of Spain.
</p>

<p>
John Sevier's son, James, bore the letter of September 12th to
Gardoqui. By a strangely ironic coincidence, on the very day
(October 10, 1788) that Gardoqui wrote to Mir&oacute;, recommending to
the attention of Spain Dr. White and James Sevier, the emissaries
of Franklin, with their plans and proposals, John Sevier was
arrested by Colonel Tipton at the Widow Brown's in Washington
County, on the charge of high treason. He was handcuffed and
borne off, first to Jonesborough and later to Morganton. But his
old friends and former comrades-in-arms, Charles and Joseph
McDowell, gave bond for his appearance at court; and Morrison,
the sheriff, who also had fought at King's Mountain, knocked the
irons from his wrists and released him on 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
parole. Soon afterward
a number of Sevier's devoted friends, indignant over his arrest,
rode across the mountains to Morganton and silently bore him
away, never to be arrested again. In November an act of pardon
and oblivion with respect to Franklin was passed by the North
Carolina Assembly. Although Sevier was forbidden to hold office
under the state, the passage of this act automatically operated
to clear him of the alleged offense of high treason. With affairs
in Franklin taking this turn, it is little wonder that Gardoqui
and Mir&oacute; paid no further heed to Sevier's proposal to accept the
protection of Spain. Sevier's continued agitation in behalf of
the independence of Franklin inspired Governor Johnston with the
fear that he would have to be "proceeded against to the last
extremity." But Sevier's opposition finally subsiding, he was
pardoned, given a seat in the North Carolina assembly, and with
extraordinary consideration honored with his former rank of
brigadier-general.
</p>

<p>
When Dr. White reported to Mir&oacute; that the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
leaders of "Frankland"
had eagerly accepted Gardoqui's conditions for an alliance with
Spain, he categorically added: "With regard to Cumberland
district, what I have said of Frankland applies to it with equal
force and truth." James Robertson and Anthony Bledsoe had but
recently availed themselves of the good offices of Governor
Johnston of North Carolina in the effort to influence Gardoqui to
quiet the Creek Indians. The sagacious and unscrupulous half
breed Alexander McGillivray had placed the Creeks under the
protection of Spain in 1784; and shortly afterward they began to
be regularly supplied with ammunition by the Spanish authorities.
At first Spain pursued the policy of secretly encouraging these
Indians to resist the encroachments of the Americans, while she
remained on outwardly friendly terms with the United States.
During the period of the Spanish conspiracy, however, there is
reason to believe that Mir&oacute; endeavored to keep the Indians at
peace with the borderers, as a friendly service, intended to pave
the way for the establishment 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
of intimate relations between Spain
and the dwellers in the trans-Alleghany. Yet his efforts cannot
have been very effective; for the Cumberland settlements
continued to suffer from the ravages and depredations of the
Creeks, who remained "totally averse to peace, notwithstanding
they have had no cause of offence"; and Robertson and Bledsoe
reported to Governor Caswell (June 12, 1787): "It is certain, the
Chickasaws inform us, that Spanish traders offer a reward for
scalps of the Americans." The Indian atrocities became so
frequent that Robertson later in the summer headed a party on the
famous Coldwater Expedition, in which he severely chastised the
marauding Indians. Aroused by the loss of a number of chiefs and
warriors at the hands of Robertson's men, and instigated, as was
generally believed, by the Spaniards, the Creeks then prosecuted
their attacks with renewed violence against the Cumberland
settlements.
</p>

<p>
Unprotected either by the mother state or by the national
government, unable to secure 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
free passage to the Gulf for their
products, and sorely pressed to defend their homes, now seriously
endangered by the incessant attacks of the Creeks, the Cumberland
leaders decided to make secret overtures to McGillivray, as well
as to communicate to Mir&oacute;, through Dr. White, their favorable
inclination toward the proposals of the one country which
promised them protection. In a letter which McGillivray wrote to
Mir&oacute; (transmitted to Madrid, June 15, 1788) in regard to the
visit of Messrs. Hackett and Ewing, two trusty messengers sent by
Robertson and Bledsoe, he reports that the two delegates from the
district of Cumberland had not only submitted to him proposals of
peace but "had added that they would throw themselves into the
arms of His Majesty as subjects, and that Kentucky and Cumberland
are determined to free themselves from their dependence on
Congress, because that body can not protect either their
property, or favor their commerce, and they therefore believe
that they no longer owe obedience to a power which is incapable
of protecting them." 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Commenting upon McGillivray's communication,
Mir&oacute; said in his report to Madrid (June 15, 1788): "I consider as
extremely interesting the intelligence conveyed to McGillivray by
the deputies on the fermentation existing in Kentucky, with
regard to a separation from the Union. Concerning the proposition
made to McGillivray by the inhabitants of Cumberland to become
the vassals of His Majesty, I have refrained from returning any
precise answer."
</p>

<p>
In his long letter of reply to Robertson and Bledsoe, McGillivray
agreed to make peace between his nation, the Creeks, and the
Cumberland settlers. This letter was most favorably received and
given wide circulation throughout the West. In a most
ingratiating reply, offering McGillivray a fine gun and a lot in
Nashville, Robertson throws out the following broad suggestion,
which he obviously wishes McGillivray to convey to Mir&oacute;: "In all
probability we cannot long remain in our present state, and if
the British or any commercial nation who may be in possession of
the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
mouth of the Mississippi would furnish us with trade, and
receive our produce there cannot be a doubt but the people on the
west side of the Appalachian mountains will open their eyes to
their real interest." Robertson actually had the district erected
out of the counties of Davidson, Sumner, and Tennessee given the
name of "Mir&oacute;" by the Assembly of North Carolina in November,
1788&mdash;a significant symbol of the desires of the Cumberland
leaders. In a letter (April 23, 1789), Mir&oacute;, who had just
received letters from Robertson (January 29th) and Daniel Smith
(March 4th) postmarked "District of Mir&oacute;," observes: "The bearer,
Fagot, a confidential agent of Gen. Smith, informed me that the
inhabitants of Cumberland, or Mir&oacute;, would ask North Carolina for
an act of separation the following fall, and that as soon as this
should be obtained other delegates would be sent from Cumberland
to New Orleans, with the object of placing that territory under
the domination of His Majesty. I replied to both in general
terms."

Robertson, Bledsoe, and Smith were successful in keeping secret
their correspondence with McGillivray and Mir&oacute;; and few were in
the secret of Sevier's effort to deliver the State of Franklin to
Spain. Joseph Martin was less successful in his negotiations; and
a great sensation was created throughout the Southern colonies
when a private letter from Joseph Martin to McGillivray (November
8, 1788) was intercepted. In this letter Martin said: "I must beg
that you write me by the first opportunity in answer to what I am
now going to say to you.&hellip; I hope to do honor to any part of
the world I settle in, and am determined to leave the United
States, for reasons that I can assign to you when we meet, but
durst not trust it to paper." The general assembly of Georgia
referred the question of the intercepted letter to the governor
of North Carolina (January 24, 1789); and the result was a
legislative investigation into Martin's conduct. Eleven months
later, the North Carolina assembly exonerated him. From the
correspondence of Joseph Martin and Patrick 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Henry, it would
appear that Martin, on Henry's advice, had acted as a spy upon
the Spaniards, in order to discover the views of McGillivray, to
protect the exposed white settlements from the Indians, and to
fathom the designs of the Spaniards against the United States.
<a href="#Note_216"><span class="superscript">[216]</span></a>
</p>

<p>
The sensational disclosures of Martin's intercepted letter had no
deterrent effect upon James Robertson in the attempted execution
of his plan for detaching the Cumberland settlements from North
Carolina. History has taken no account of the fact that Robertson
and the inhabitants now deliberately endeavored to secure an act
of separation from North Carolina. In the event of success, the
next move planned by the Cumberland leaders, as we have already
seen, was to send delegates to New Orleans for the purpose of
placing the Cumberland region under the domination of Spain.
</p>

<p>
A hitherto unknown letter, from Robertson to (Mir&oacute;), dated
Nashville, September 2, 1789, proves that a convention of the
people 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
was actually held&mdash;the first overt step looking to an
alliance with Spain. In this letter Robertson says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I must beg your Excellency's permission to take this early
opportunity of thanking you for the honor you did me in writing
by Mr. White.
</p>

<p>
I still hope that your Government, and these Settlements, are
destined to be mutually friendly and usefull, the people here are
impressed with the necessity of it.
</p>

<p>
We have just held a Convention; which has agreed that our
members shall insist on being Seperated from North Carolina.
</p>

<p>
Unprotected, we are to be obedient to the new Congress of the
United States; but we cannot but wish for a more interesting
Connection.
</p>

<p>
The United States afford us no protection. The district of Mir&oacute;
is daily plundered and the inhabitants murdered by the Creeks,
and Cherokees, unprovoked.
</p>

<p>
For my own part, I conceive highly of the advantages of your
Government.
<a href="#Note_217"><span class="superscript">[217]</span></a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A serious obstacle to the execution of the plans of Robertson and
the other leaders of the Cumberland settlements was the prompt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
action of North Carolina. In actual conformity with the wishes of
the Western people, as set forth in the petition of Robertson and
Hayes, their representatives, made two years earlier, 
<a href="#Note_218"><span class="superscript">[218]</span></a>
the legislature of North Carolina in December passed the second act
of cession, by which the Western territory of North Carolina was
ceded to the United States. Instead of securing an act of
separation from North Carolina as the preparatory step to forming
what Robertson calls "a more interesting connection" with Spain,
Robertson and his associates now found themselves and the
transmontane region which they represented flung bodily into the
arms of the United States. Despite the unequivocal offer of the
calculating and desperate Sevier to "deliver" Franklin to Spain,
and the ingenious efforts of Robertson and his associates to
place the Cumberland region under the domination of Spain, the
Spanish court by its temporizing policy of evasion and indecision
definitely relinquished the ready opportunities thereby afforded,
of utilizing the powerful separatist tendencies 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
of Tennessee for
the purpose of adding the empire upon the Western waters to the
Spanish domain in America.
</p>

<p>
The year 1790 marks the end of an era&mdash;the heroic age of the
pioneers of the Old Southwest. Following the acceptance of North
Carolina's deed of cession of her Western lands to the Union
(April 2, 1790) the Southwest Territory was erected on May 26th;
and William Blount, a North Carolina gentleman of eminence and
distinction, was appointed on June 8th to the post of governor of
the territory. Two years later (June 1, 1792) Kentucky was
admitted into the Union.
</p>

<p>
It is a remarkable and inspiring circumstance, in testimony of
the martial instincts and unwavering loyalty of the transmontane
people, that the two men to whom the Western country in great
measure owed its preservation, the inciting and flaming spirits
of the King's Mountain campaign, were the unopposed first choice
of the people as leaders in the trying experiment of
Statehood&mdash;John Sevier of Tennessee and Isaac Shelby of Kentucky.
Had 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Franklin possessed the patient will of Kentucky, she might
well have preceded that region into the Union. It was not,
however, until June 1, 1796, that Tennessee, after a romantic and
arduous struggle, finally passed through the wide-flung portals
into the domain of national statehood.

The discovery of an immense quantity of contemporary documents, since
Roosevelt's <i>The Winning of the West</i> was written, betrays the numerous
inaccuracies of that fascinating work, as well as the imperfect perspective in
the picture of the westward expansionist movement. Mr. Roosevelt's virile
apotheosis of the strenuous pioneer seems today almost as old-fashioned in its
method and outlook as is Draper's work on King's Mountain.

Extended investigation establishes beyond question that Judge Henderson was
proceeding in strict accordance with law in seeking to acquire title by purchase
from the Cherokees instead of applying to the royal government for a grant.
When Virginia's sea-to-sea charter was abrogated in 1624, Virginia became a
royal province and the settlement of boundaries a royal prerogative. Of the
three presumed Indian claimants to the trans-Alleghany region, viz., the
Iroquois, Shawanoes, and Cherokees, the Iroquois by defeating the Shawanoes and
their confederates in the Ohio Valley at the battle of Sandy Island in 1672
acquired title, as understood by the Indians, to this region. By the treaties of
Lancaster (1744), Loggstown (1752), and Fort Stanwix (1768), the claims of the
Shawanoes and the Iroquois to the trans-Alleghany territory were ceded to the
crown. While the Shawanoes and the Cherokees acquiesced in the Treaty of Fort
Stanwix, the crown fully acknowledged the claim of the Cherokees to the
trans-Alleghany region; and by the treaties of Hard Labor (1768) and Lochaber
(1770) confirmed them in possession of this region to the west of the boundary
line (See Chapter XII). The sovereignty of England extended over this territory,
the right of eminent domain being vested in the crown. Henderson was legally
justified in disregarding the royal proclamation of 1763 which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
largely in the nature of a temporary expedient, and in purchasing the title to
the trans-Alleghany region from the Cherokees in 1775. The right of eminent
domain over the trans-Alleghany region still vested in the crown after the
treaty of Sycamore Shoals.

<h2><a href="#contents">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</a></h2>

<p>
For the entire period (1740-1790) covered by this volume, an exceptionally rich
store of materials is to be found in the <i>Colonial Records of North Carolina,
1662-1775</i> (published 1886-1890), and its continuation, the <i>State Records of
North Carolina, 1776-1790</i> (published 1895-1905), thirty volumes in all,
including the four volumes of index. The introductions and supplementary matter
in these volumes constitute a survey of the period. Theodore Roosevelt's <i>The
Winning of the West</i> (1889-1896; various editions), a vigorous and stirring
narrative, over-accentuates the strenuous life, largely underemphasises
economic and governmental phases, and is by no means free from error. 
</p>
<p>
For the Scotch-Irish migrations one should read C.&nbsp;A. Hanna, <i>The Scotch-Irish</i>
(2 vols., 1902), a large collection of original materials, imperfectly
co&ouml;rdinated; and the excellent historical sketch by H.&nbsp;J. Ford, <i>The 
Scotch-Irish in America</i> (1905). For the German migrations, adequate and
readable accounts are A.&nbsp;B. Faust, <i>The German Element in the United States</i>
(2 vols., 1909); J.&nbsp;H. Clewell, <i>History of Wachovia in North Carolina</i> (1902);
J.&nbsp;W. Wayland, <i>The German Element of the 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Shenandoah Valley of Virginia</i> (1907); and G.&nbsp;D. Bernheim, <i>History of the
German Settlements and of the Lutheran Church in North and South Carolina</i>
(1872). 
</p>
<p>
The best original sources for the life of the people in this period are: the
State Archives of North Carolina at Raleigh, scientifically ordered and
accessible to collectors; the Lyman C. Draper Collection at Madison, Wisconsin;
the Reuben T. Durrett Collection at the University of Chicago; the State
Archives of South Carolina, especially rich in collections of contemporary
newspapers; the collections of the North Carolina Historical Society at Chapel
Hill; and the Archives of the Moravian Church, in Pennsylvania and at 
Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The State Archives of Virginia, an unexplored
mine of great riches, are as yet inaccessible, properly speaking, to
investigators. The state of Tennessee has not yet made any provision for the
conservation of historical materials; but the Tennessee Historical Society has
preserved much valuable documentary material.
</p>
<p>
Books shedding light, from various quarters, upon the life of the people in this
period are: W.&nbsp;H. Foote, <i>Sketches of North Carolina, Historical and
Biographical</i> (1846; reprinted 1913), dealing almost exclusively with the 
Presbyterian Church and the Scotch-Irish; J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;D. Smyth, <i>A Tour in the United
States of America</i> (2 vols., 1784), untrustworthy as to historical events and
partisan as to politics, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
but graphic in description of the people and the country; William Bartram,
<i>Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida</i>
(1791), delightful in its simplicity and genial tone; William Byrd, <i>History of
the Dividing Line</i> and other writings (J.&nbsp;S. Bassett's edition, 1901), of
sprightly style and instinct with literary charm, pungently satirical,
untrustworthy as to North Carolina; Joseph Doddridge, <i>Notes on the Settlement
and Indian Wars &amp;c.</i> (1824; reprinted 1912), photographic in its realistic
delineation of backwoods conditions; J.&nbsp;H. Logan, <i>History of Upper South
Carolina</i> (1859); J. Rumple, <i>Rowan County</i> (1881; reprinted 1916);
<i>Biographical History of North Carolina</i> (8 volumes printed, 1905-); S. Dunbar,
<i>A History of Travel in America</i>(4 vols., 1915), first volume; <i>Travels in the
American Colonies, 1690-1783</i> (Edited by N.&nbsp;D. Mereness, 1916); and O.&nbsp;Taylor,
<i>Historic Sullivan</i> (1909). 
</p>
<p>
Many valuable articles, of both local and national interest, are found in the
excellent periodical publications: <i>James Sprunt Historical Monographs and
Publications</i> (16 vols., 1900-), published by the University of North Carolina;
<i>North Carolina Booklet</i> (18 vols., 1901-), published by the N.&nbsp;C. Society, 
D.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R.; <i>Virginia Magazine of History and Biography</i> (27 vols., 1893-); <i>American
Historical Magazine</i> (8 vols., 1896-1903); <i>Tennessee Historical Magazine</i> (4
vols., 1915-); <i>Register of the Kentucky State Historical Society</i> (17 vols.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
1902-); <i>Mississippi Valley Historical Review</i> (6 vols., 1914-). A notable study
is F.&nbsp;J. Turner, <i>The Old West</i> (Wisconsin Historical Society Proceedings,
1908). 
</p>
<p>
There is no adequate account in print of the French and Indian War, in the Old
Southwest. Useful sources are E. McCrady, <i>South Carolina under the Royal
Government, 1719-1776</i> (1899); S.&nbsp;A. Ashe, <i>History of North Carolina,
1584-1783</i> (1 vol., 1908); L.&nbsp;P. Summers, <i>History of South-West Virginia,
1746-1786</i> (1903); J. P. Hale, <i>Trans-Alleghany Pioneers</i> (1886); J. A. Waddell,
<i>Annals of Augusta County</i>, Virginia (1886); S. Kercheval, <i>A History of the
Valley of Virginia</i> (third edition, 1902); A.&nbsp;S. Withers, <i>Chronicles of Border
Warfare</i> (R.&nbsp;G. Thwaites' edition, 1908); B.&nbsp;R. Carroll, <i>Historical Collections
of South Carolina</i> (2 vols., 1886); E.&nbsp;M. Avery, <i>History of the United States</i>
(7 vols., 1908), fourth volume; J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;M. Ramsey, <i>Annals of Tennessee</i> (1853);
<i>Calendar Virginia State Papers</i> (11 vols., 1875-1893). An interesting biography
is A.&nbsp;M. Waddell, <i>A Colonial Officer and his Times</i> (1890). 
</p>
<p>
The early explorations of the West, and the career of Boone, are treated with
reasonable fullness in the admirable publications of the Filson Club of Kentucky
(27 vols., 1884-); C.&nbsp;A. Hanna, <i>The Wilderness Trail</i> (2 vols., 1911); John
Haywood, <i>Civil and Political History of Tennessee</i> (1823; reprinted 1891),
written in delightfully quaint style; 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
L. and R.&nbsp;H. Collins, <i>History of Kentucky</i> (2 vols., 1882), a mine of
conglomerate material; N.&nbsp;M. Woods, <i>The Woods-McAfee Memorial</i> 
(1905); A.&nbsp;B. Hulbert, <i>Pilots of the Republic</i> (1905) and <i>Boone's 
Wilderness Road</i> (1903), attractively written; R.&nbsp;G. Thwaites, 
<i>Daniel Boone</i> (1911), a lifeless condensation of Draper's sprawling 
projected (MS.) biography; and John Filson, <i>Kentucke</i> (1784). 
</p>
<p>
Of the voluminous mass of literature dealing with the Regulation in North
Carolina, one should read: J.&nbsp;S. Bassett, <i>The Regulators of North 
Carolina, 1765-1771</i> (American Historical Association Report, 1894); M. 
DeL. Haywood, <i>Governor Tryon of North Carolina</i> (1903); H. Husband, 
<i>An Impartial Relation of the First Rise and Cause of the Present 
Differences in Publick Affairs, in the Province of North Carolina</i> 
(1770); and Archibald Henderson, <i>The Origin of the Regulation in North 
Carolina</i> (American Historical Review, 1916). 
</p>
<p>
In addition to titles already mentioned, the following books and monographs give
the best accounts of the Watauga and Cumberland settlements and of the State of
Franklin: A.&nbsp;W. Putnam, <i>History of Middle Tennessee</i> (1859), a remarkably
interesting book by a real "character"; J.&nbsp;W. Caldwell, <i>Constitutional History
of Tennessee</i> (second edition, 1907); F.&nbsp;M. Turner, <i>Life of General John
Sevier</i> (1910), in pedestrian style, reasonably accurate for the romantic period
only; G.&nbsp;H. Alden, <i>The State of Franklin</i> (American Historical Review, 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
1903); S.&nbsp;B. Weeks, <i>Joseph Martin</i> (American Historical Association Report,
1894); Archibald Henderson, <i>Isaac Shelby</i> (North Carolina Booklet, 1917-1918).
The source book for the Indian war of 1774 is <i>Documentary History of Dunmore's
War</i> (Edited by R.&nbsp;G. Thwaites and L.&nbsp;P. Kellogg, 1905). For exhaustive data
concerning the King's Mountain campaign and its preliminaries, read L.&nbsp;C.
Draper, <i>King's Mountain and its Heroes</i> (1881), though the book is lacking in
discrimination and deficient in perspective. For a briefer treatment, read D.&nbsp;L.
Schenck, <i>North Carolina, 1780-1781</i> (1889). 
</p>
<p>
Other books and monographs dealing with the period, the westward movement, the
settlement of the trans-Alleghany, and the little governments, to be consulted
are: James Hall, <i>Sketches of the West</i> (2 vols., 1835) and <i>The Romance of
Western History</i> (1857); <i>Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia</i> for
1766-1769 and 1770-1772 (published 1906); G.&nbsp;H. Alden, <i>New Governments West of
the Alleghanies before 1780</i> (published 1897); C.&nbsp;W. Alvord, <i>The Mississippi
Valley in British Politics</i> (2 vols., 1917), a notable work, ably written and
embodying an immense amount of information; J.&nbsp;T. Morehead, <i>Address at
Boonesborough, May 25, 1840</i> (published 1840); F.&nbsp;J. Turner, <i>The Significance
of the Frontier in American History</i> (Wisconsin Historical Society Proceedings,
1894) and <i>Western State-Making in 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
the Revolutionary Era</i> (American Historical Review, 1895-1896), papers
characterised by both brilliance and depth; and Archibald Henderson, <i>The
Creative Forces in Westward Expansion</i> (American Historical Review, 1914), <i>The
Occupation of Kentucky in 1775</i> (Mississippi Valley Historical Review, 1914),
<i>The Founding of Nashville</i> (Tennessee Historical Magazine, 1916), and <i>The
Spanish Conspiracy in Tennessee</i> (Tennessee Historical Magazine, 1917).
</p>
<p>
On the subject of Indian tribes and Indian treaties, the <i>Annual Reports of the
Bureau of Ethnology</i>, in especial numbers 5, 18, and 19, although compiled from
secondary historical sources and occasionally erroneous in important matters,
are useful&mdash;as is also Bulletin 22: J. Mooney, <i>Siouan Tribes of the East</i>
(1895). Rare and interesting works dealing with the Eastern Indian tribes are
H. Timberlake, <i>Memoirs</i> (1765); J. Haywood, <i>Natural and Aboriginal History of
Tennessee</i> (1823); and J. Adair, <i>American Indians</i> (1775).

Historical Literature of North Carolina</i> (1895); E.&nbsp;G. Swem, <i>A Bibliography of
Virginia</i> (Part I, 1916); and the bibliographies in 
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
J. Phelan, <i>History of Tennessee</i> (1888); E. McCrady, <i>South Carolina under the
Royal Government, 1719-1776</i> (published 1899) and <i>South Carolina in the
Revolution, 1775-1780</i> (published 1901); and E.&nbsp;M. Avery, <i>A History of the
United States</i> (1908), volumes 4, 5, and 6.

<h2><a href="#contents">Transcriber's Notes</a></h2>
<p><br ></p>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>
We have retained the original punctuation and spelling in the book, but
not in the index.  Obvious errors were corrected--and all of 
these changes can be found in the <i>Detailed Notes Section</i> of these
notes.  The <i>Detailed Notes Section</i> also includes issues that have
come up during transcription.  One common issue is that words are sometimes 
split into two lines for spacing purposes.  These words are hyphenated in 
the physical book, but there is a question sometimes as to whether the 
hyphen should be retained in transcription.  The reasons behind some of 
these decisions are itemized.
</p>
<p>
There were numerous errors in the index.  Places like the Ouasioto Gap and
the Green River, which were spelled consistently and correctly throughout
the text, ended up as "Onasioto" and "Guen" in the index.  Such errors 
detract from the index.  Therefore, corrections were made to the index and 
listed in the Detailed Notes Section.  
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h3>Detailed Notes Section:</h3>



<div class="notes">
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_viii">Page viii</a>:<br>
	In his letter to the Earl of Dartmouth, Lord Dunmore wrote the clause 
	"Should for ever immagine the Lands further off..."  This is a direct 
	quote; the spelling is correct.  
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Preface</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_xvii">Page xvii</a>:<br>
	Home-builder is hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing purposes, 
	giving us two choices on how to transcribe the word.  The word was not
	used again in the book.  However, "home-makers" was used on Page 17, and the
	word included a hyphen and was in the middle of the line.  We believe that
	the author's use of home-makers signals the author's intent to keep the 
	hyphen in "home-builder." So we kept the hyphen.
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter III</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_39">Page 39</a>:<br>
	Powder-horn is hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing purposes, 
	giving us two choices on how to transcribe the word.  On Page 213, 
	powder-horns with the hyphen appears in the middle of a line.  That was the 
	only other occurrence of the word in the book.  Therefore, we kept the hyphen.
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter VI</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
	&bull; <a href="#Page_68">Page 68</a>:<br>
	The author used the original spelling of the fort on page 68 in the clause
	"To this fort, named Fort Loudoun in honor of Lord Loudoun," but changed
	the spelling to modern usage (Fort Loudon) on pages 76, 88, and 90.  We 
	made no modifications and retained the spelling from the text. 
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter VII</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
	&bull; <a href="#Page_98">Page 98</a>:<br>
	C&eacute;loron de Bienville is spelled with a grave accent despite the
	correct spelling (according to Wikipedia) of C&eacute;loron on 
	<a href="#Page_46">Page 46</a>.  The spelling in the book was retained. 
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter VIII</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_127">Page 127</a>:<br>
	Half-breed is hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing purposes, 
	giving us two choices on how to transcribe the word.  On Page 141, 
	half-breed with the hyphen appears in the middle of a line.  That was the 
	only other occurrence of the word in the book.  Therefore, we kept the hyphen.
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter IX</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_133">Page 133</a>:<br>
	Life-time is hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing purposes, 
	giving us two choices on how to transcribe the word.  There was no other 
	occurrence of life-time or lifetime in the book.  We kept the hyphen.
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter XII</h4>
<p class="noindent">
  &bull; <a href="#Page_181">Page 181</a>:<br>
	Court-room is hyphenated and split between two lines for spacing
	in the clause "the Regulators took possession of the court-room."
	On page 180, court-room is spelled with a hyphen in the middle of
	a sentence, so we retained the hyphen here.	<br >  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_194">Page 194</a>:<br>
	There is a printer's mistake on page 194: the first line of page 194 is
	actually the last line of page 194.  The line "ston River, south and east 
	of Long Island;" which is on the top line of page 194 in the printed book, 
	should be on the bottom line, below "however, to the settlement north of 
	the Hol-." We have transcribed the book making this adjustment to the text.
	<br >
	&bull; <a href="#Page_195">Page 195</a>:
	We have removed (See map for settlement and treaty lines.) because our
	transcription does not have images scanned.
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter XIV</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_224">Page 224</a>:<br>
	(Compare map.) after "including the Nolichucky Valley." was removed
	because maps and images have not been scanned and included in our
	transcription of the book.
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter XVI</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_266">Page 266</a>:<br>
	Rendez-voused was hyphenated for spacing and split between two lines
	in the clause "Colonel William Christian rendez-voused." Rendezvous is 
	written without the hyphen on pages 59, 203, 226, and 292.  Therefore, 
	the hyphen was omitted in transcribing rendezvoused.
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter XVII</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_270">Page 270</a>:<br>
	Far-flung is hyphenated for spacing and split between two lines in the 
	clause "along the farflung frontier of Kentucky."  There are no other 
	occurrences of the word.  Far-away, far-visioned, and far-reaching were
	used in the book.  Far west, far north, and far faint were used in the 
	book, but replacing the hyphen with a space is not an option in
	transcribing hyphenated words.  There weren't any options with far being
	part of a conjoined word.  The hyphen was retained in far-flung. <br>
	&bull; <a href="#Page_283">Page 283</a>:<br>
	Flat-boats is hyphenated for spacing and split between two lines in
	the clause: "about thirty flatboats, dugouts."  On Page 285, flatboats 
	is not hyphenated, so the hyphen was not kept in transcribing the same 
	word on page 283.<br>
	&bull; <a href="#Page_286">Page 286</a>:<br>
	Co-partners is hyphenated for spacing and split between two lines in
	the clause: "contract between the copartners."  There were no other
	occurrences of the word.  We did not use the hyphen here.<br>
	&bull; <a href="#Page_287">Page 287</a>:<br>
	Entry-taker is hyphenated for spacing and split between two lines in
	the clause: "the entry-taker being appointed by Judge Henderson."  
	On Page 220, "entry-Taker" was used in a quote from Joseph Martin. 
	There were no other occurrences of the word.  We retained the hyphen.
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter XVII</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_293">Page 293</a>:<br>
	Over-mountain men is hyphenated for spacing and split between two lines in
	the clause: "the over-mountain men gathered on September 25th." This word was
	used other times in the book, on pages 295, 306, and 316.  Each time it was 
	spelled with a hyphen, so we have kept the hyphen here, too.  <br>
	&bull; <a href="#Page_303">Page 303</a>:<br>
	Battle-field is hyphenated for spacing and split between two lines in
	the clause: "His frenzied efforts on the battle-field ..." This word was
	used three other times, on pages 54, 214, and 306.  Each time it was spelled
	with a hyphen, so we have kept the hyphen here, too. <br>
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Chapter XIX</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_315">Page 315</a>:<br>
	In Sevier's quote, "we shall pursue no furtheir measures as to a new State,"
	the spelling of furtheir matches that of Henderson's book.  Because this
	is a quote, no change was made, although Sevier meant further.
	<br>
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Index</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
  &bull; <a href="#Page_393">Page 393</a>:<br>
	In the book, the clause "begins erection of Catawba" is embedded between "see 
	<i>Land Companies</i>" in the Index entry for Wabash Land Companies.
	That clause belongs before "Fort, 70;" in the entry under Hugh Waddell.  
	We have made the correction.  <br>
</p>
<p><br ></p>
<h4>Spelling Errors in the Index</h4>
<p class="noindent">  
	As described in the Introduction to the Transcriber Notes, the book has 
	numerous spelling errors in the index.  Here is a list of changes made
	<em>only</em> to the Index, and <em>only</em> because a new, incorrect
	variation of the word was introduced in the index.</p>

	<li>Moved "begins erection of Catawba," misplaced under index entry Wabash 
	    Land Company to Waddell, Gen. Hugh.  The sub-entry is "begins erection

and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade; works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg&trade; License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg&trade; work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p class="boilerplate">This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg &trade; License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.F.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg&trade;
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES: Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  <i>You agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in Paragraph F3.  You agree that the Foundation, the 
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be 
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or 
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage. </i>

<p class="boilerplate">1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND: If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', <em>with no other 
warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to

</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">1.F.6.  INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg&trade;
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;</p>

<p class="boilerplate">Project Gutenberg &trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg's&trade;
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p class="boilerplate">Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<em>send donations</em> or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate.</p>

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg&trade;
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p class="boilerplate">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

<p class="boilerplate" style="text-align:center; margin-top:0;">http://www.gutenberg.net
</p>

<p class="boilerplate">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
